Hi there! I am ready whenever you are :),124,generic
"yes, I agree. Information transmission is a process in communication technology that enables information to move from a source location to a destination",124,transmission
"okay, thanks again. bye",124,generic
"Again to Jill: Yes, I agree with the behavioristic view that reinforcement strengthens behavior because I think when someone is encouraged and praised for their right or good actions they feel satisfied and accordingly motivated to repeat these actions.",123,transmission
All right. Thanks for the interesting discussion and for getting involved. Good luck with the course!,123,interactivity
"And as for Ms Allen's point of view. She thinks that feedback should be explained directly. I think it depends on the type of task. If it's a multiple-choice task digital feedback can be a good idea. But if it is a task with open questions or when you need to write something, in this case, I think it's better to explain it directly.",123,transmission
And I agree with you about the use of differnet platforms. I think they are really useful nowadays because of Covid situation.,123,generic
"And I also agree with the statement about peer feedback. The simplest explanation is that you give feedback to someone and you receive feedback from someone. But the point is that every student should be involved in it. Otherwise, it wouldn't work. At least it's not fair if someone stays away.",123,transmission
And what about you?,123,generic
Are you still there? I'm not sure that you are receiving my messages.,123,generic
"As for the first statement, I agree with it. Because feedback is the information teacher gives to students about their performance. But I also think it can be considered more broadly. As the teacher can not just give information about students' results but also give extra info about a topic or something like this, especially if he/she sees that students are interested in it.",123,transmission
"But in the matter of fact, this course, and the idea of MOOCs in general, I like very much as an organization. Here you can go at your own pace and take time when you have the opportunity, but at the same time you get the opportunity to discuss different topics with colleagues and get a different point of view. Still, I miss the opportunity to ask questions to teachers as soon as they arise.",123,legit

"I also now remember that it was very interesting and useful for me when our professors encouraged us to make an annual portfolio, working on a specific task every time, the results of which we then shared in moodle and was free to discuss by our colleagues. This creates the preconditions for further discussion and thus both parties win - some receive feedback on their work, and others learn something new through the provoked discussion.",123,transmission
"I am from Bulgaria and I am also studying at the university at the moment, a bachelor. With us, things started quite difficult - in 2020 we received only written materials in form of Word documents, as they were sent to us in 3 different places and we were given tasks on them. This was quite confusing and difficult for all students and fortunately the teachers understood it and accordingly in the winter semester of 2020 things got a little better. However, even then and to this day, several platforms are used - Moodle, Zoom, Teams, Google Meet. This makes work very difficult because you are constantly wondering ""Which platform should I enter in this discipline?"", but at least we already have face-to-face contact with all professors and it really helps us a lot, because we can ask questions right away when we don't understand something.",123,transmission
"I believe that the use of platforms such as Moodle, Google Classroom, closed Facebook groups and others can very successfully accompany the traditional learning process that takes place in the classroom. For example, it has always been very useful for me when my university professors have used similar platforms and shared information about the organization of lectures before each lecture, as well as additional resources and notes from the lecture itself after it has ended.",123,learning
"I definitely do not think that the use of social media necessarily leads to people reading less, but I also do not agree that communication and learning on social networks can replace face-to-face communication.",123,media
"I do not completely agree that punishment necessarily leads to negative consequences, but most learners are usually demotivated by punishment, so I as a teacher would not use this method in an attempt to motivate someone to learn. But there are still people who are actually mobilizing and working more focused after being punished for a similar previous act.",123,learning
I like MOOCs too. And I think it's an advatage to be able to discuss topics with peers form different countries.,123,legit
I think teachers can create some activities for students that they should use their devices to do them. But it shouldn't last for the whole lesson as students need to communicate face-to-face with each other and with a teacher.,123,interactivity
I think we can leave,123,generic

I'm fine. Thank you :),123,generic
"I'm from Russia. I'm studying at university. And we have online classes. We use MS Teams. I actually like this platform as there are many things you can do there. I had a really interesting experience of using different tools when I was studying at UAB, Barcelona. I had a course ""Resouces for Teaching English"". I found out that there are so many interesting tools.",123,interactivity
"Is it time to close the chat? Since I was still not included in the course last week and could not take part in the previous discussion, I do not know whether we should wait for the conversational agent to close the discussion or just leave after 45 minutes.",123,interactivity
It's a quite confusing situation. It is good that you have face-to-face contact. Some students from my university have offline classes. I wish we also have because it seems I've already forgotten how it is to study face-to-face.,123,interactivity
Let's discuss the first question. :),123,generic
"My last sentence probably is not clear. I mean that when a student made a mistake, it would be better if they see the correct answer. It can make feedback more efficient.",123,transmission
Ok,123,generic
Okay. Let's discuss the case. :),123,generic
"Punishments is a quite complicated question. I think it depends on a person's character. For example, when one person receives a punishment, it can be a disaster for him, as he may think that he cannot do anything right or he even may think that he's a bad person. But for another person, punishment can be a kind of motivation - to do something better next time or to be better than someone. And there're some other cases.",123,transmission
So what do you think? How could we find the balance between the both points of view?,123,generic
"So, do you want to discuss somethnig else, or should we close the chat?",123,generic
Speaking about reinforcement. I agree that it strengthens behaviour. And I think it works at any age. Especially it can be noticeable with children. It is a motivation for them because they understand if they do this they receive a reward. And it can be something simple. But with time such extrinsic motivation can develop into intrinsic motivation.,123,transmission

"""Technology"" is a broad concept, so in some point - yes",122,technology
About the other thing we were talking about... I consider a good feedback to be descriptive. So that's why I am trying to extend the definition of feedback.,122,transmission
"Actually, it would be interesting to collect the students answers before anything to check prior knowlegde. Then topic is explained. Then there is the simulation and discussion to make the understanding of the topic deeper and correct misconceptions. Then the final test. The professor can compare the learner's knowlegde before and after the test, and evaluate the improvement together with the final grade. I believe this way the FB can be more processual. What do you think?",122,interactivity
"After the test, not during...",122,generic
And I agree with your previous words. Mr. Heineken should reduce the gap between him and his students,122,generic
And the technology can be used for the instant feedback during the simulation.,122,technology

"As for Ms. Wells, her position is too radical. Complete elimination of face-to-face classes may lead to unexpected results. I suppose, it would negatively affect studentsâ€™ socialization and interpersonal relationships in general. These two components â€“ digital learning and offline interaction should be in balance.",122,learning
"As for the statement - the word ""intervention"" has a negative connotation for me. Orchestration in my opinion, is an action of bringing pieces together and managing them to function.",122,learning

I like your schema very much. And I think it is very clear.,122,generic

I think graphic organizers is very interesting to have an overview of a topic and relate different concepts.,122,representation
I think I will argument that Mr. Heineken needs to explore more social media in a different way. There's a lot of learning there. The problem is with the use it. Professors and students need to learn how to use in order to explore it in the most.,122,media
"I think it is interesting, Irina. But I am not familiar with graphic organizers. Have you used it before?",122,representation
I think it might include some kind of a visual representation. You can choose from one of these variants.,122,representation
I think Mr. Heineken can explore more social media to change his mind in that regards,122,media
I think Mr. Heineken can promote learning experiences in social media. He would be surprise with the rich discussions that happen in there.,122,media
I totaaly agree with you Irina! The evaluation criteria is not clear. And I would add that a feedback should have the criteria as a starting point.,122,transmission
I understand that,122,generic

I would like to hear your opinion about Mr. Allen's reasoning.,122,transmission
I would say that a good feedback would also include input in how to improve.,122,transmission

I'm not sure I'm able to come up with something good. I was thinking about graphical organizer that could help a teacher and a student to detect strengths and weakness in their work and performance during a certain period of time. But this thought is incomplete.,122,representation

Let's start then?,122,generic
"Maybe there's a language barrier for me here, but I suppose that inquiry learning is a form of learning through investigation, which is definitely active.",122,learning
Maybe this feedback might be descriptive. It is not just the case here with Ms Brown.,122,transmission
"Maybe, if Mr. Heineken is so concerned about students wasting their time on their smartphones, he can offer them other exciting AND useful digital activities to show students that smartphones could be treated differently. He could learn more about BYOD policy and encourage his students to search for information and share their findings by making educating posts on different topics. Another option is to ask students to collect certain information for a group project using their devices. Mr. Heineken can also suggest students a range of apps for micro learning on his subject or interesting Instagram/Twitter accounts and YouTube channels. This could help them to do something more useful with their screen time than just aimlessly scrolling through the news feed.",122,learning
"Mr. Heineken can create the bridged between what his students are doing in social media with the class, create learning communties and enrich his classes with meaniful discussions",122,media

Should we stop as the time is off?,122,generic
"So, hereâ€™s the specific solution that I will suggest. Ms. Brown should make answers for the tests optional while editing, because there are different situations where answers will or will not be needed. I think the following algorithms are optimal.  Training test â†’ indicate right and wrong answers, suggest materials for revision (perhaps, with links) â†’ if there are still questions left, plan a group or individual discussion Final test â†’ indicate right and wrong answers, explain them (note useful sources on the topic if needed) â†’ if there are still questions left, plan a group or individual discussion",122,transmission

Sure!,122,generic
Sure! If possible,122,generic
Technology included tools but is not limited to it.,122,technology
Thank you and have a great weekend,122,generic
Thank you for participation! It was very interesting for me! I wish you luck in your studies and hope you'll be able to have a good rest soon!,122,generic
Thank you very much!,122,generic
"Thank you very much, Irina! It was nice discuss it with you!",122,generic
Thank you! haha,122,generic
"Thank you! I see, we are on the same line here :)",122,generic
Thanks a lot!,122,generic
That is very interesting!,122,generic
That would work! But for now I'm out of ideas about how she can change her FB.,122,technology
That's just great. I don't know what to add... It was very clever of you to think about the process,122,generic
That's okay,122,generic
That's well worded :),122,generic
There' only the inal assigment now,122,generic
This chat is a bit weird when it comes to typying haha,122,generic
This simulation The feedback can be given in general during the discussion and a more specific and personal one after the final test.,122,transmission
"Well, I partially agree that students would learn more if the correct answer would be indicated. It depends on the type of the test. Is it training test that helps you to check your knowledge and correct it? Then itâ€™s better to indicate right and wrong answers and suggest a student to revise materials before taking the test again. Our brains remember things better if it was difficult to find the information. If it was too easy (e.g if the right answer was given right after), you'll probably won't process the fact, and it'll vanish from your memory as soon as you end the course.",122,transmission
"Well, okay. Let's skip it. Maybe I didn't get something right",122,generic
What are your thoughts on this case?,122,generic
What do you think about it? I'm really interested?,122,generic
"What do you think about my point of view, Irina?",122,generic
What type of feedback do you think we can say that Mr.Brown is giving to his students?,122,generic
What you think you did not get right?,122,generic
"Wow, I couldn't come up with something as unusual as this. Brilliant!",122,generic
"Yeah, I just was typing about it! I believe, that it is possible to give fine feedback on test digitally.",122,transmission
"Yeah, same! Thank you a lot! Here in Russia we say ""two heads ae better than one"" :D",122,generic
"Yeah, that would be useful for him",122,generic
Yep,122,generic
Yep,122,generic
"Yes, exactly! It's the professor's rule to help students developing metacogtive strategies for learning so they can actually learn.",122,learning
"Yes, I agree with the statement. Because these tools organize concepts and ideas in a visual manner.",122,technology
"Yes, I agree!",122,generic
"Yes, I do as well. For me AR is a real world enriched with hidden or additional information",122,augmented
"Yes, I see. In addition, some students are quiet in class but really chatty on the internet",122,interactivity
"Yes, I think we need to find a balance. Many researches have showed the affects of 100% online teaching/learning in students social and emotional life",122,learning
"Yes, it says exactly what needs to be changed and gives specific advises",122,generic
"Yes, let's start",122,generic
"Yes, that's the definition of AR",122,augmented
"Yes, that's what I said :)",122,generic
"Yes, we should!",122,generic
"Yes. If the learning activities are well planned, then yes!",122,learning
"Yes. Mr. Brown ""feedback"" is not complete. You have a good proposal! However, don't you think having a discussion right after the test would be more effective?",122,transmission
Hello! Let me know when you are online :),122,generic
"Hello there! My name is Irina, Iâ€™m from Rostov-on-Don, Russia. And you?",122,generic
I am Rebeca and I am from Brazil.,122,generic
Nice meeting you!,122,generic
I am wondering if you are also a student at Saarland University...,122,generic
Nice! Last time I didnâ€™t have a partner. My pleasure to meet you as well! What time is it at your place?,122,generic
I am in Germany right now. It is 16:01.,122,generic
"If you were allocated at this time last friday, then it was my fault. I apologize.",122,generic
I did let the tutor know though.,122,generic
Should we start discussing the topic?,122,generic
"No, I'm not :) I'm a student of Southern Federal University (Russia)",122,generic
That is very interesting!,122,generic
That's okay,122,generic
"Yes, let's start",122,generic
I would like to hear your opinion about Mr. Allen's reasoning.,122,generic
"Well, I partially agree that students would learn more if the correct answer would be indicated. It depends on the type of the test. Is it training test that helps you to check your knowledge and correct it? Then itâ€™s better to indicate right and wrong answers and suggest a student to revise materials before taking the test again. Our brains remember things better if it was difficult to find the information. If it was too easy (e.g if the right answer was given right after), you'll probably won't process the fact, and it'll vanish from your memory as soon as you end the course.",122,interactivity
"Is it a final test to check what youâ€™ve learned during the semester? Then it should contain explanations for the right answer, as thereâ€™s only one take and students might feel anxious about not knowing what exactly they did wrong. Some of them might even feel discriminated since thereâ€™s no explicit or transparent system of evaluation.",122,transmission
"I partially agree with Mr.Allen as well. The part I disagree is that feedback cannot be implemented digitally. I think depends on the type of feedback, right?",122,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: Feedback refers to transmission of information about learner performance. Why?,122,transmission
"Yeah, I just was typing about it! I believe, that it is possible to give fine feedback on test digitally.",122,transmission
I would say that a good feedback would also include input in how to improve.,122,transmission
I totaaly agree with you Irina! The evaluation criteria is not clear. And I would add that a feedback should have the criteria as a starting point.,122,transmission
"It's a good answer. Maybe, it also explains why something was said or did wrong.",122,generic
What type of feedback do you think we can say that Mr.Brown is giving to his students?,122,transmission
Definetely not descriptive.,122,transmission
For sure,122,generic
But can it be descriptive in tests?,122,transmission
"After the test, not during...",122,generic
I understand that,122,generic
"Well, okay. Let's skip it. Maybe I didn't get something right",122,generic
What you think you did not get right?,122,generic
Maybe this feedback might be descriptive. It is not just the case here with Ms Brown.,122,transmission
descr,122,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Descriptive feedback contains specific information. Why?,122,transmission
"Yes, I agree!",122,generic
Should be personal and specific.,122,generic
"Yes, it says exactly what needs to be changed and gives specific advises",122,generic
About the other thing we were talking about... I consider a good feedback to be descriptive. So that's why I am trying to extend the definition of feedback.,122,transmission
"Okay, I get it :) I think we're both on the same line about the situation in case. Should we discuss our thoughts on how Ms. Brown can improve?",122,generic
"So, hereâ€™s the specific solution that I will suggest.

Sure! If possible,122,generic
Interesting suggestion,122,generic
"Instead of having two tests. They could have a simulation, discussion, then a test.",122,interactivity
That would work! But for now I'm out of ideas about how she can change her FB.,122,interactivity
"I wanted to specify, that I didn't mean two tests in a row. My punctuation might be a bit confusing. It's just two different types of test that might be used.",122,interactivity
"Actually, it would be interesting to collect the students answers before anything to check prior knowlegde. Then topic is explained. Then there is the simulation and discussion to make the understanding of the topic deeper and correct misconceptions. Then the final test. The professor can compare the learner's knowlegde before and after the test, and evaluate the improvement together with the final grade. I believe this way the FB can be more processual. What do you think?",122,transmission
This simulation The feedback can be given in general during the discussion and a more specific and personal one after the final test.,122,transmission
"Please, desconsider ""This simulation"".",122,representation
"Wow, I couldn't come up with something as unusual as this. Brilliant!",122,generic
And the technology can be used for the instant feedback during the simulation.,122,technology
Thank you! haha,122,generic
That's just great. I don't know what to add... It was very clever of you to think about the process,122,generic
Do you think we could think about a better way to use technology in the feedback?,122,technology
I like your schema very much. And I think it is very clear.,122,generic
I'm not sure I'm able to come up with something good. I was thinking about graphical organizer that could help a teacher and a student to detect strengths and weakness in their work and performance during a certain period of time. But this thought is incomplete.,122,representation
"Do you both agree with the following statement: Graphic organizers include PMI diagram, Venn diagram, concept maps. Why?",122,representation
"I think it is interesting, Irina. But I am not familiar with graphic organizers. Have you used it before?",122,representation
I think it might include some kind of a visual representation. You can choose from one of these variants.,122,representation
"No, I've only seen other people using it in their work. I thought it was informative.",122,generic
I'm not aware of the tools for making them as well...,122,generic
"Yes, I agree with the statement. Because these tools organize concepts and ideas in a visual manner.",122,representation
Should we stop as the time is off?,122,generic
I think graphic organizers is very interesting to have an overview of a topic and relate different concepts.,122,representation
"Yes, we should!",122,generic
"Thank you very much, Irina! It was nice discuss it with you!",122,generic
"Sorry, if you were expecting more from our discussion :D Thank you for your time and thoughts!",122,generic
Good luck then!,122,generic
No way. It was very interesting for me!,122,generic

Do you both agree with the following statement: Orchestration refers to teacher interventions. Why?,122,learning
"Yeah, same! Thank you a lot! Here in Russia we say ""two heads ae better than one"" :D",122,generic
are*,122,generic
"I would say that it refers more to teacher planning than intervention. What do you think, Irina?",122,learning
"I am not quite sure if it's an ""intervention"" so to say...",122,learning
"Orchestration refers more to combining the different approaches. Of course, when you do that you intervenes in the learning envioroment.",122,learning
"As for the statement - the word ""intervention"" has a negative connotation for me. Orchestration in my opinion, is an action of bringing pieces together and managing them to function.",122,learning
intervene*,122,generic
That's well worded :),122,generic
"Thank you! I see, we are on the same line here :)",122,generic
I,122,generic
This chat is a bit weird when it comes to typying haha,122,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Learning activities refers to learning opportunity. Why?,122,learning
I have the same feeling,122,generic
"Yes. If the learning activities are well planned, then yes!",122,learning
Do you see how Jack's questions are related to the study case?,122,generic
I can't yet...,122,generic
"I'm not sure about this one. Learning opportunities are realized in the form of activities in which you can learn somethin, I'd say..",122,learning
I agree,122,generic
"Not to the study case, but to videos",122,generic
Yep,122,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Technology refers to tools. Why?,122,technology
Technology included tools but is not limited to it.,122,technology
includes*,122,generic
"""Technology"" is a broad concept, so in some point - yes",122,technology
I agree with Rebeca on this,122,generic
"In a broader sense, technologies are also methods of action, their organization, tools, etc.",122,technology
"Rebeca, what do you think about the second question in the case?",122,generic
Last time I was fascinated by your out of the box thinking!,122,generic
Here's what I came up with:,122,generic
"Maybe, if Mr. Heineken is so concerned about students wasting their time on their smartphones, he can offer them other exciting AND useful digital activities to show students that smartphones could be treated differently. He could learn more about BYOD policy and encourage his students to search for information and share their findings by making educating posts on different topics. Another option is to ask students to collect certain information for a group project using their devices. Mr. Heineken can also suggest students a range of apps for micro learning on his subject or interesting Instagram/Twitter accounts and YouTube channels. This could help them to do something more useful with their screen time than just aimlessly scrolling through the news feed.",122,learning
I think Mr. Heineken can promote learning experiences in social media. He would be surprise with the rich discussions that happen in there.,122,media
"Yes, exactly! It's the professor's rule to help students developing metacogtive strategies for learning so they can actually learn.",122,learning
"Yes, I see. In addition, some students are quiet in class but really chatty on the internet",122,interactivity
role not rule*,122,generic
I think Mr. Heineken can explore more social media to change his mind in that regards,122,media
"Yeah, that would be useful for him",122,generic
"As for Ms. Wells, her position is too radical. Complete elimination of face-to-face classes may lead to unexpected results. I suppose, it would negatively affect studentsâ€™ socialization and interpersonal relationships in general. These two components â€“ digital learning and offline interaction should be in balance.",122,learning
I agree,122,generic
What do you think about it? I'm really interested?,122,generic
"Oh, I see:D",122,generic
!*,122,generic
"Yes, I think we need to find a balance. Many researches have showed the affects of 100% online teaching/learning in students social and emotional life",122,learning
effects*,122,generic
"Sorry about my writing today, Irina. I am a bit distracted. I think I am too tired today. Lack of sleep :(",122,generic
"No problem! I hope, I'll have some time for a nap after our discussion!",122,generic
Not really hahaha,122,generic
Oh noo,122,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Inquiry learning refers to active learning. Why?,122,learning
I think I will argument that Mr. Heineken needs to explore more social media in a different way. There's a lot of learning there. The problem is with the use it. Professors and students need to learn how to use in order to explore it in the most.,122,media
"Mr. Heineken can create the bridged between what his students are doing in social media with the class, create learning communties and enrich his classes with meaniful discussions",122,media
Inquiry is definetely an active way to learn and that could be explore in social media,122,media
"What do you think about my point of view, Irina?",122,generic
"Maybe there's a language barrier for me here, but I suppose that inquiry learning is a form of learning through investigation, which is definitely active.",122,learning
"Yes, that's what I said :)",122,generic
And I agree with your previous words. Mr. Heineken should reduce the gap between him and his students,122,generic
"I hope, it doesn't sound odd",122,generic
Yep,122,generic
It makes sense,122,generic
"Do you both agree with the following statement: Augmented Reality or AR refers to, enhanced version of real physical world. Why?",122,augmented
"Yes, that's the definition of AR",122,augmented
yes. Augmented reality is the present and future,122,augmented
ohhhh maybe Mr. Heineken can use AR in his classes,122,augmented
"Yes, I do as well. For me AR is a real world enriched with hidden or additional information",122,augmented
"Nice discussion with you again, irina!",122,generic
Thank you and have a great weekend,122,generic
Is it the last discussion in the course?,122,generic
"Oh, I think you are right",122,generic

"(fixing the sentence)  The Professor asks Ms. Deo to explain the principles of multimedia to the students and divides the lectures between the groups so that each group applies the principles of multimedia to the scientific material. After that, each group explains to the remaining groups what it has done. Thus, the professor has achieved several goals simultaneously, namely encouraging cooperative education and training students on the principles of multimedia. Finally, the students will have learned the content well, as they will be interested in understanding the content well so as to find the best way to present it, and the professor is the expert who will be available to help them if they encounter any difficulty.",121,media
*to add?,121,generic
:D :D,121,generic
"Actually, can you elaborate a bit more on the privacy concerns, I feel I missed the point",121,generic
after test discussion is important but if a students don't know his mistakes it's loses value...feedback should contain info about what skills need to improve.,121,transmission
"Agreed, but also Ms. Allen is likely going to be more open to changing here approach as she is already on a relatively better standing.",121,generic
"ah, true",121,generic
"aha, yes indeed",121,generic
"also, he provides very few arguments, and those arguments are mostly linked with young people's social skills and he asumes that technology makes people damb, but I think it is the opposite technology gives young people opportunity to not memorize but analyze, example: any kind of information is already avaliable in internet at any time at any place, so it is not obligatory for now days to just memorize those fact when you easily can just google it, so here's a deal, educators must be more focused on how can they help students to learn basic principals, connections between concepts and how can they make their life easier, which is much more challenging than to just give homework to students and chech their memory skills.",121,technology
and also the demanding skills. which skill set is requered to be presented form student.,121,learning
"and for Ms. Doe, I think it's good that she thinks multimedia is important",121,generic
"and those young people are university students, not school pupils  :D",121,generic
"anyway, in conclusion both of MS.Heineken and Ms. Wells needs carefully consider those privacy matter.",121,generic
are u here?,121,generic
As a Guide I guess,121,generic
"as in, I am missing some thing",121,generic
"as we hear from  videos, the new technology approaches getting boring for students soon, I think Ms Wells might have such problem in future.",121,technology
"based on the skills that the learner should learn, I think that there is another dimension that we can think of, which is the level of the feedback. E.g. giving hints only, or iterative feedback, ...",121,transmission
"because I think, it is essential to know the content that we want to improve its presentation, as not all contents can be improved, for example, theories and definitions for some materials, it may be preferable to present them only and interested in explaining their meaning instead of Interested in embodying it?",121,learning
"but even with such tools, the teacher would need to give high-level feedback and double check the low level feedback provided by the tools",121,transmission
But how does the learning process work?,121,learning
But I think that it is also good to integrate the digital content of educational programs in a deliberate and specific way that will be very useful.,121,generic
but if our aim is to improve student's critical thinking,121,transmission
"but if the test is finished, how hints can change the situation?",121,generic
but Mathematical proof assignments (unless a proof checker exists) would really need manual feedback :D,121,transmission
but school wifi can easily block those sources,121,transmission
"but that need not be disclosed, right?",121,generic
"but we actually don't know what cohort is Ms. Heineken is talk about, maybe MS.heineken and MS. wells are university lecturers",121,generic
"But, by telling us that the students have created their own learning communities, we may infer from this that there is another effective way to learn this material",121,learning
"but, first of all both of them need to chose pedagogical approach and than chose what type of technology they prefer to use, (social-media, mobile-learning, forums, chats or etc.)",121,interactivity
"but, what do you think if the questions was True/False?",121,generic
"by doctor, I meant Professor :D",121,generic
can you elaborate more?,121,generic
Certainly I think he can keep a space for students to learn from different sources and advise them,121,learning
"Cool, yea. And I think we are on the same page, so that's great. and we pretty much covered everything :)",121,generic
different tasks probably need different automatic feedback solutions (if available),121,transmission
Discuss to what extent you agree with Ms. Brown's and/or Ms. Allen's reasoning.,121,generic
"even if the school doesn't allow digital devices, students could share things when they go home -- if they have access to digital devices at home",121,transmission
"face to face description is very effective, but feedback also needs to be quick.",121,transmission
feedback should be clear/ useful/ contains only relevant info/ quick and etc.,121,transmission
feedback which contains information about strengths and weaknesses and also steps for future improvment,121,transmission
"for me, I understand Mrs. Brown's reasons for preferring evaluative feedback rather than descriptive one because descriptive feedback required more time  and It is great that she is very nice from her to be interest in explaining important things better",121,transmission
"for my point of view Ms. Heinekens reasoning is very naive, to add, one of the main 21 century skill is digital literacy, if he is so negative towards technology based learning, I don't think he's work will be effective.",121,learning
good luck with assignment :),121,generic
haha :D,121,generic
"He only provides if students answers were wrong or right, without showing them the correct way of dealing with task.",121,generic

"Hi, I'm online :)",121,generic
"Hi, I'm online, how are you?",121,generic
"hi, I'm online, I'm good, how are you?",121,generic
hints can help students to be more activley involved.,121,generic
"hmm, I thinkn",121,generic
"hmmm... good point, perhaps by requiring using a student email or a teacher-created account. and then allow reporting misbehavior?",121,generic

How are you?,121,generic
how can I call you? what's your real name? mine's Mariami (Mari for short),121,generic
"I agree with you that technology can be used to enhance the education process. Thus eliminating it completely is probably going to yield worse outcomes. On the other hand, I think memorizing is one of the life skills that youth should train their brains on (along with other life/thinking skills)",121,technology
"I agree with you, approach should come first",121,generic
I agree with you.,121,generic
"I agree with your problem solving, I just have a queistion, like privacy matter is very important, how can Ms Wells or Ms. Heineken can enhance safe interaction within students?",121,interactivity
"I agree, because for me personally, I learn better when I receive detailed feedback",121,transmission
"I agree, Thank you a lot :) It was nice to chat with you :)",121,transmission
"I also have a question regarding to Prof. Smith's content, example if the presented information relavant to course material why students have to search additional info from other sources?",121,transmission
"I also partially agree with  Ms.wells, in relying on digital education instead of traditional, but not for all educational stages and not for all disciplines",121,transmission
"I am afraid I will need to go in a few minutes for another class, I think we have covered all points",121,generic
I can also summarize the points related to the second point,121,generic
"I completely agree with you, but if the teacher wants to give detailed individual feedback to each student it would be very time-consuming",121,transmission
"I completely agree with you, virtual-only setting can easily become boring, and students will quickly feel isolated and lonely",121,virtual
I find a lack of information given as a kind of educational material for the doctor who might help us to make suggestions,121,transmission
"I guess He can enhance students and also can be a ""role-model""",121,generic
"I had such impression towards her vision, but I'm not sure.",121,generic
"I just had an impression that she kind of loosing the main point, I mean it not only works in this way:  ""the more and flashier the merrier! "". I think topic is also equally important, the content.",121,generic
I like this integration of the points,121,generic
"I mean blanded method, where teacher uses technology based feedbacks and also provides some direct detailed feedback (verbally or textually) this can be more effective.",121,technology
"I mean, it's also depands on test format, open-questions indeed needs more descriptive feedback.",121,transmission
I partially agree with Mr. Heineken opinion that it is not advisable for young people to spend too much time on smartphones and other devices rather than socializing with their peers,121,technology
"I see, yes, I think this makes sense as the feedback type will depend on many variables",121,transmission

I do think that the feedback should be given as soon as possible, however, writing a few sentences to point out the mistakes and good parts won't be such a difficulty. Another option is peer feedback. Ms Brown may start an open poll, or a blog, where students can share their opinions on the work of others. I had such a practice at my university, and it works great!

Firstly, you cannot find all the information that you need via OER, therefore the learner will largely benefit from the teacher's lectures. In Ukraine, this approach is widely used in language courses. Secondly, you can contribute to the learning community by creating your own content and posting it online. I have an example of a Ukrainian teacher of Physics who created his own video lessons in three years and posted them online. Now students and teachers all over Ukraine use his content, which I find amazing.",118,learning

I think one part to include in the class could be to also encourage the students to create presentations using multimedia. By this, he would make the lesson even more interactive, the students would benefit and learn a lot and there is a chance that he could learn also from the students and their presentations.

"Yes, good point to include peer feedback. I had the first experience with giving peer feedback this semester and it works really well. It makes the student reflect the work of their peers, but also their own work. So I think two-way communication helps to talk about the specific task in detail, ask questions, discuss. This gives probably even more insights into the topic.",118,transmission

"Yes, I agree. Like Mr. Heineken, I am also very critical of social media and think there are a lot of disadvantages. and to be honest, I am not a big fan of using social media in the classroom. But digital tools in general should definitely including in teaching and learning, as you said: they are helpful in creating a better learning environment.",118,technology
"Yes, I like all of these tools and apps. They make learning a fun activity!",118,learning
"Yes, I think media competence is the foundation of learning with media. To be able to learn with and from media, it is essential to use it critically, to reflect and be able to differentiate between valid information and wrong information.",118,media
"Yes, I totally agree. Recording your own videos is important, too. I like the aspect you mentioned about posting them online and contributing to the learning community. This gives the videos and effort even more value.",118,learning
"Yes, it's all about the balance:) Well, I think we've covered all the main points by now. Is there anything you would like to add?",118,generic
"Yes, right. To focus too much on group work can also be negative for those how have to work with passive group members or for really shy people who don't benefit that much from group work and are more effective when working individually. So it's again about finding a balance!",118,transmission
"Yes, rotation model (individual learning units are performed online) and flex model (virtual learning by face-to-face teacher as needed) are part of hybrid learning",118,interactivity
"Yes, that's true. Especially helping with the learning platform would really support the students. In this use case I'm just worried about the knowledge of the teacher about the whole technological elements. Since until now, he didn't even use multimedia for his teaching, I think it will be a big change for him to include all these new elements in class.

"Hey, I'm online too :) Good, how are you?",118,generic
"I'm fine, thanks. Let's start discussing the assignment, shall we?",118,generic
"Sure, let's then start with the first topic ""Discuss to what extent you agree or disagree with Prof. Smith and Ms. Doe."", alright?",118,generic
Alright. I would like to say that I partially agree with Prof. Smith. I like it when the lectures are well-structured and presented with bullet points.,118,generic
"Yes, I agree. I think he is providing the most important information to the students, instead of giving to much additional information (coherence principle).",118,generic
"However, I also believe that he needs to change his approach to classic scheme of creating presentations. I think he should follow these steps:",118,generic
"He should use visual hierarchy, meaning using two fonts, contrasting colours and different media (pictures, charts) ONLY when it is necessary. I also believe that Prof. Smith is to declutter his learning materials (=to remove unnecessary inf.), organize the presentations in a similar way and remove the unnecessary clicks (=all links should be easily accessible)",118,representation
"Good points, I agree with them. As far as I understood, he isn't really using visual elements, so he should focus on adding these to his teaching, as you said. But he should be careful to not overload his presentations. That's my critique on Ms. Does approach to make the presentations very fancy, ""the more and fleshier the merrier"". They should find a balance between making his teaching more visual and interactive but without overloading it and distracting the learners.",118,representation
"I totally agree with you! I also feel like Ms Doe's approach is a bit over the top. The multimedia should only be used for a specific purpose, not for making presentations pretty and fun",118,media
Yes! I think they could probably work well together if they are willing to learning from each other. With both approaches they could create some really good multimedia content for the students.,118,media
Exactly. What is your attitude to students creating a learning community? How can a teacher participate in this community? What would his role be?,118,learning
"I think the fact that they created a learning community by themselves, shows how much they need and want to learn together. I strongly support this idea, because they will probably benefit from it. I think the key element in this situation is the teacher's attitude towards this approach and besides updating his presentations, this should be the other fundamental change he should make: actively engaging them to collaborate, giving tasks to work on in the learning community, giving them enough time in class to work together, providing tasks to think critically and debate about...",118,learning
What do you think?+,118,generic
"Yeah, totally. A learning community provides an opportunity to share values and vision and learn collectively. In this case, a teacher may provide supportive conditions that you've mentioned, as well as help as an outside consultant. A teacher may be in handy in organizing the learning process outside the classroom as well, such as helping with the learning platform and keeping things SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Results-Focused and Timely. He will also be able to access the learners' progress.",118,learning
"Yes, that's true. Especially helping with the learning platform would really support the students. In this use case I'm just worried about the knowledge of the teacher about the whole technological elements. Since until now, he didn't even use multimedia for his teaching, I think it will be a big change for him to include all these new elements in class. So this will be really challenging for him.",118,media
True. Probably he should again collaborate with Ms Doe so that it would be easier for him to get used to all the technological advances. What multimedia do you think he should include in his presentations? Can you give a few examples?,118,media
"I really like the use of short videos with sound, instead of just giving some plain text. This would make the lesson much more entertaining for the students. Plus including some interactive parts, maybe a quiz. What examples do you have?",118,interactivity
"Your examples are great! I would also add the following: video clips, graphs, GIFs, pop-ups, maps, GR codes, music and TED-Talk video embeds. Also links to additional resources at the end. Again, it's important to mention that he shouldn't use all of these ideas at once. One or two per presentation will do.",118,learning
"Wow, really good examples! Using these elements will really improve the lesson. And yes, he should definitely ensure not to use more than 1 or 2 per presentation. I think one part to include in the class could be to also encourage the students to create presentations using multimedia. By this, he would make the lesson even more interactive, the students would benefit and learn a lot and there is a chance that he could learn also from the students and their presentations. Since they are probably familiar with technology and might bring some new inspiration into the class. And personally, I've always learned the most when I had to prepare a project or presentation for the class.",118,media
"Yes, good idea! He might learn a lot from his students. One more point that I would like to cover is his encouragement to work in groups. That is undoubtfully great, but I believe it should be mixed with individual and pair work. It can be challenging to get to one point when one participant of the group is active and the others are passive. So I think all the types of social activities should be included. And as you've mentioned, they can create representations together as a project, individually and in pairs!",118,interactivity

who* not how,118,generic
"Yes, it's all about the balance:) Well, I think we've covered all the main points by now. Is there anything you would like to add?",118,generic
I think so too and time's up anyway :) Nothing to add from my side.,118,generic
"OK, so we can conclude that it's essential to use multimedia to create presentations. However, overusing multimedia and technology might be as harmful, if not more harmful for the learning process than not using them at all. Thank you for this thoughtful discussion. It was a great exchange of thoughts that was truly beneficial. See you:)",118,media
"Good conclusion! Thank you too, I got some new insights! :) Have a nice day, bye!",118,generic
Hello! How are things?:),118,generic
"Hey, I am online, how are you?",118,generic
"I'm good, thanks. Let's start discussing the topic, shall we?",118,generic
"Sure :) So, what do you think about Ms Brown's app and her opinion?",118,generic
"I believe that the fact that she has an app is amazing, it is a great assessment tool, but I'm not sure it's good for providing feedback. I believe that she should put more effort into giving feedback, use the thumb approach (point out 2-3 good things and 1 thing to improve). Also, when the incorrect answers are shown, the correct answer should also be indicated. What do you think?",118,transmission
Do you both agree with the following statement: Feedback refers to transmission of information about learner performance. Why?,118,transmission
"I agree with you, the app is amazing but as it is now, only Ms Brown benefits because she can use it for evaluation and grading. The students will probably not learn much, because they don't learn the correct answer, as you've already said. Your suggestion for providing feedback is good, I think this would bring added value to the students.",118,transmission
"I agree with the statement, because feedback provides information about how well the student is doing or if (and what) there are fields that could be improved. It gives an overview about the current state of performance.",118,transmission
"I do partially agree with this statement. I think it is an essential part of the evaluation. However, we should also focus on the correction process, giving advice on what can be improved in the future.",118,transmission
"Well, what do you think about Ms. Allen's approach?",118,generic
"I think she is too critical about the app, saying ""this is not a good approach"". As we've said: the app needs some improvement, but I see potential. Ms. Allen is sceptical and says that feedback cannot be implemented digitally at all, but I don't agree. It is difficult to provide good feedback digitally and there are important factors to be considered, but there are also a lot of potentials and advantages using an app. What do you think?",118,transmission
"That's true. As I've said, Ms Brown may indicate the correct/incorrect answers, as well as provide the students with all correct answers, and also give a short comment on the performance. I do think that the feedback should be given as soon as possible, however, writing a few sentences to point out the mistakes and good parts won't be such a difficulty. Another option is peer feedback. Ms Brown may start an open poll, or a blog, where students can share their opinions on the work of others. I had such a practice at my university, and it works great! I also started to notice my own mistakes more effectively.",118,transmission
Do you both agree with the following statement: Peer feedback refers to two-way communication process. Why?,118,transmission
"Yes, good point to include peer feedback. I had the first experience with giving peer feedback this semester and it works really well. It makes the student reflect the work of their peers, but also their own work. So I think two-way communication helps to talk about the specific task in detail, ask questions, discuss. This gives probably even more insights into the topic.",118,transmission
"I totally agree with the statement. I would even say that it's a three-way communication process. 1) One student provides feedback to the other student, may comment on other's work in a precise manner, using prompts; 2) The other student reacts to the feedback, probably asks additional questions and may give his own as well to the other students; 3) The teacher teaches feedback rules and monitors how the peers review each other",118,transmission
"Yeah, good point to mention the teacher's role. I think especially for students with less experience in giving peer feedback or younger students his role is essential! To provide guidance when problems or questions come up",118,transmission
"Not only can Ms Brown implement peer feedback, but she can also give feedback by recording audios (which is a quick process, on the contrary to typing comments) and sending them via an app. It is important that the feedback is descriptive and provided in time so that students can analyse their progress. What other ways can you add?",118,transmission
"That's a good way, so she could give individual feedback to every student. I was thinking about including an audience response system (ARS), additionally. So, she could interview the learners all at the same time and gather answers. She will see immediately which questions were difficult and discuss these topics in details again. So in addition to giving individual feedback, this would be a way to deepen the knowledge of certain fields.",118,transmission
Do you both agree with the following statement: Audience response systems are used for audience voting. Why?,118,transmission
"I don't think so. I agree with my colleague that one can ask and answer questions via this tool. It's used to gather different opinions, rather than voting for one. It's also a good way to engage students in the learning process.",118,transmission
"I partially agree, I think: yes, the audience can vote in ARS, simply put, but this view is too easy. Much more can be done, as it has already been mentioned: gather opinions, discussing, reflecting.",118,transmission
"Another visual tool that may be used is badges. However, I think they might demotivate the students and even start a feud between them, as students will become jealous of the more 'successful ones'. The simple grading approach is also flawed, as giving the students A's, B's etc. provides no actual information on improving one's performance. Do you agree?",118,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: Badges display accomplishments. Why?,118,learning
"Yes, I agree, they can easily start conflicts and demotivate students. They display accomplishments, but the absence of badges could display failing.",118,learning
"So, to come to a conclusion: we both like the idea of using an app, but Ms Brown should ensure to provide valuable, descriptive and in-time feedback. She could for example use audios to give individual feedback to the students. In addition, ARS could be used to foster in-class discussions. Do you want to add something?",118,transmission
"I do agree with the statement. I would also say they not only display achievements but also give context on how did the student achieved it. However, a badge may become a goal for a student, the same as a grade, instead of being a feedback/evaluation device.",118,transmission
I totally agree with your conclusion. Nothing to add;),118,generic

"Hello, I am online:) How are you?",118,generic
Hey there!,118,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Orchestration refers to teacher interventions. Why?,118,learning
"Well, I do partially agree with the following statement. However, first and foremost, orchestration is about how we use technology in the classroom environment, and only then we can talk about how the teacher can support the learning process and make it efficient.",118,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: Learning activities refers to learning opportunity. Why?,118,learning
I agree with what MARI said about orchestration. About learning activities and learning opportunities: I agree because these two terms are related to each other. Learning activities are learning opportunities because they allow the learner to learn.,118,learning
"I suggest we start our discussion with Mr Heineken's approach. I believe it is true that children are too engaged in their gadgets, but we cannot ignore the fact that gadgets and other technological tools are helpful in creating a better learning environment. So, if incorporated with care, digital tools might be largely beneficial. What do you think?",118,learning
I agree with Masi on learning activities and opportunities. Learning activities allow students to enhance their knowledge on a particular topic and practice as well.,118,learning
"Yes, I agree. Like Mr. Heineken, I am also very critical of social media and think there are a lot of disadvantages. and to be honest, I am not a big fan of using social media in the classroom. But digital tools in general should definitely including in teaching and learning, as you said: they are helpful in creating a better learning environment.",118,technology
"And I disagree with Ms. Wells, who says that you can completely eliminate face-to-face classes. As we've seen during the pandemic: this is not the best way to go. Social interaction and face-to-face learning is very important. So it's about balance again.",118,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: Roles refers to roles in classroom. Why?,118,interactivity
"I totally agree with you. I think it's safe to say that blended learning is the best option for both Mr Heineken and Ms Wells. Blended learning, especially the flipped classroom approach, is incredibly beneficial to students. The students can practice with the teacher, ask questions about the materials, and review the lectures whenever they want. It is a perfect combination of face-to-face and online learning.",118,interactivity
"I think it's not only about the roles in the classroom. It's also important that teachers and learners also stay by these roles outside the classroom, for example via blog discussions on social media. The teacher may support the student in and out of the classroom, as well as the learner may learn outside the classroom as well.",118,interactivity
"For sure! I think so too: this is the perfect combination. I love including videos and online materials for self-regulated learning, but always in combination with in-class discussions, time for questions and quizzes to test the knowledge of the learners and make sure they really watch the videos.",118,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: Mobile learning refers to learning with mobile devices. Why?,118,interactivity
What other digital learning opportunities can you suggest?,118,technology
"About the roles: I think that especially today, with the online tools, social media etc., it is important that teachers keep the role of the teacher. It can probably be tempting to shift towards the role of a friend, when communicating online and through social media, but this should be avoided.",118,technology
"Mobile learning is defined by using mobile devices, e.g. distance learning or using online apps.",118,interactivity
"Yes I agree. Mobile learning means using mobile devices, for example with apps with micro-learning content or games, geo-tracking...",118,technology
"About your question about the digital learning opportunities: I think teachers should check the OER, which are freely accessible and can bring a lot of benefit for their teaching. For example, using YouTube videos or Ted talks or other resources (for example oercommons.org)... this can save a lot of time because they don't have to create all the content by themselves and there is a lot of really good material out there which can support a lesson",118,learning
What do you have to add?,118,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Inquiry learning refers to active learning. Why?,118,learning
"Well, I do agree with you, but I also think that it would be great to record your own videos as well. Probably not all of them, but at least some of them. Firstly, you cannot find all the information that you need via OER, therefore the learner will largely benefit from the teacher's lectures. In Ukraine, this approach is widely used in language courses. Secondly, you can contribute to the learning community by creating your own content and posting it online. I have an example of a Ukrainian teacher of Physics who created his own video lessons in three years and posted them online. Now students and teachers all over Ukraine use his content, which I find amazing.",118,learning
"I do agree with the statement on inquiry learning, it is extremely engaging for students and involves a lot of interaction.",118,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: Exploratory learning encourages exploration. Why?,118,learning
"Yes, I totally agree. Recording your own videos is important, too. I like the aspect you mentioned about posting them online and contributing to the learning community. This gives the videos and effort even more value.",118,learning
"I also suggest using online tools and apps, such as Quizlet, Wordwall, Kahoot, and even Duolingo. All these apps serve different purposes, but all of them make the learning process fun and engaging. They can provide students with additional practice or an opportunity to revise the material.",118,learning
"Yes, I agree with the statement: learning by exploration supports the natural curiosity of learners and by exploratory learning they learner can learn a lot!",118,learning
"Yes, I like all of these tools and apps. They make learning a fun activity!",118,learning
"Do you both agree with the following statement: Augmented Reality refers to, enhanced version of real physical world. Why?",118,augmented
"This statement is totally correct, exploratory learning involves learning through experiments, which may help learners to gain more insight into particular topics.",118,learning
"Yes, because augmented reality uses the real world, but additional digital elements can be added",118,augmented
"Indeed. Augmented Reality, in contrast to virtual reality, implements virtual elements into a reality.",118,virtual
"I really like augmented reality as a tool for learning. I think it is not a tool every teacher can just use nowadays (too expensive), but I know that it is used for some training, for example to train doctors. Really interesting tool to combine the real world with virtual elements.",118,learning
"Do you both agree with the following statement: Hybrid learning includes rotation model, flex model. Why?",118,interactivity
"Yes, rotation model (individual learning units are performed online) and flex model (virtual learning by face-to-face teacher as needed) are part of hybrid learning",118,interactivity
"Right, I have seen this technology applied for conducting experiments in physics and chemistry, as well as laboratory work.",118,technology
Do you both agree with the following statement: Media competence is vital for learning with media. Why?,118,media
"Yes, the rotation and flex model are considered to be variations of hybrid learning, as well as self-blend and enriched virtual model.",118,learning
"I agree. You don't have to be an IT specialist, but you need to understand the concept of media and how to use it effectively.",118,media
"Yes, I think media competence is the foundation of learning with media. To be able to learn with and from media, it is essential to use it critically, to reflect and be able to differentiate between valid information and wrong information.",118,media

"I agree in part with this statement, as it is correct in the sense that these tools enable information collection, but at the same time this is not the only benefit of them in addition to you having other benefits",117,transmission
I agree to what you said.. not every subject is sufficient enough to teach only by presentation,117,representation
I agree with Ghafiq,117,generic
i also agree,117,generic
I am Ghafiq Alkurdi,117,generic
i am happy to see you response,117,generic
i can avoid that by making a wide range of badge so every on can get a suitable badget,117,learning
"I know, unfortunately the domain subject is not clear on the case study",117,generic

I think forming their own community is a positive think regardless of their Option about the material,117,generic
"I think he should not seriously cancel his method of teaching, but he should change and develop it",117,generic
i think inquiry learning is branch or subcategory of active learing,117,learning
I think so. It can become a habit. Exploratory learning can only be done through exploration,117,learning
I think that is possible,117,generic
"I think that it is also related to the study subjects. There may be a problem that the same method is applied in all subjects, and this is completely wrong.",117,generic
i think the professor is wrong ?,117,generic
"I think the statement 'learning activities refers to learning opportunities' kind of speaks by itself.. If there is no activity, how can students have the opportunity to learn? Learning activities can be thought as the vehicle to get the opportunities",117,learning
i think we call the bended learning a educational arrangement,117,learning
I think we have one more question to discuss,117,generic
if he use the laptop that also mobile learning,117,generic
"In order for Mr. Brown to improve its application, you may give the badges to the students",117,learning
"In the end, we want to emphasize that the opinion of the students is very important and that the use of presentations or others is a proven way to achieve better learning",117,learning
in the same time,117,generic
informative or descriptive feedback is more beneficial to learning than purely evaluative good bad feedback or feedback based on school grades,117,learning
"Interesting.. But, how do you think the professor do that?",117,generic
Isn't it the case study?,117,generic
it can be accessed by the app,117,generic
It collects and displays information at the same time,117,generic
It is a little difficult for me to answer this question because I think I need a little more context,117,generic
It is clear to me that Mrs. Brown is wrong and her colleague is absolutely right,117,generic
It is clear to me that Mrs. Brown is wrong and her colleague is absolutely right,117,generic
it really depends on the domain subject,117,generic
just about the opinions,117,generic
Just modify his teaching as he needs,117,generic

shall we discuss these questions:,117,generic
"So now we want to confirm what we agreed on, which is that Mrs. Brown, in order to improve her application, must provide answers to questions for students and collect using the awarness tools in order to collect and analyze information and show this information to students and she must use the badges and wiki pages",117,transmission

some thing similar to the wiki pages that we created in our eductech wiki,117,generic
sorry I was just searching for the link to the chat,117,generic
thank you too,117,generic
that is rights,117,generic
that mean the learner can learn every where,117,generic
That way Ms. Brown can give students suggestions and examples how to improve their performance,117,generic
thats means the we agree that inquiry leaning is active leaning but in the same time active leaning is a wider concept,117,learning
that's what I thought the first time,117,generic
The feedback from the students is in the solution key. He must listen to the studentsâ€™ suggestions and take them seriously,117,transmission
The first step The professor should listen to the student and take feedback from them,117,transmission
The professor should take advantage of these new learning communities,117,learning
the time is finished without discussion of the scenario,117,generic
then we agree that freely accessible is the essential aspect of it,117,generic
these are open questions there are no correct answer,117,generic
they are examples of hybrid learning,117,learning
they are supposed to be free,117,generic
think that the orchestration is wider Concept that just teacher intervention,117,learning
This analytical thing would be much less efficient if the feedback is done only in person,117,transmission
This can be done through direct interviews,117,generic
This is an essential thing to make information such as participation rate and others visible to everyone,117,transmission

yeah I know,117,generic
Yeah that can be done,117,generic
Yeah true,117,generic

It is clear to me that Mrs. Brown is wrong and her colleague is absolutely right,117,generic
informative or descriptive feedback is more beneficial to learning than purely evaluative good bad feedback or feedback based on school grades,117,learning

combination by making the feedback descriptve and easy,117,transmission
in the same time,117,generic

for me I do not agree with this Statement because opportunity and activity are different Things,117,learning
"I think the statement 'learning activities refers to learning opportunities' kind of speaks by itself.. If there is no activity, how can students have the opportunity to learn? Learning activities can be thought as the vehicle to get the opportunities",117,learning
you can have an opportunity whiteout activity,117,learning

no i think the roles also include the roles in team work an eves in solo learing,117,interactivity
I agree with Ghafiq,117,generic
It is a little difficult for me to answer this question because I think I need a little more context,117,generic

these are open questions there are no correct answer,117,generic
just about the opinions,117,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Mobile learning refers to learning with mobile devices. Why?,117,interactivity
also the term of mobile learning is wider than learning with mobile devices,117,learning
mobile here refers to the concept of mobility,117,generic

that mean the learner can learn every where,117,learning
if he use the laptop that also mobile learning,117,generic

yes that is the definition of micro learning,117,learning

Blended learning is an approach where the teacher combines Face to Face learning and online learning.,117,learning
i think we call the bended learning a educational arrangement,117,learning
"educaional  approaches  like Constructivist, Collaborative, Integrative, Reflective and Inquiry Based Learning",117,learning

i also agree,117,generic
they are examples of hybrid learning,117,learning
because they are combines online educational materials with traditional in-person classroom methods,117,interactivity
the time is finished without discussion of the scenario,117,generic
"yes, thank you ^^",117,generic
thank you too,117,generic
:) see you,116,generic
agree with that,116,generic
Agree with you. I personally find that methodology incredibly frustrating.,116,generic
Also I think that explanatory answers should be embedded as pop-up options that students can click on and find out more. Maybe even including external links or audio explanations of the correct answers.,116,transmission
"Also interacting with other students and building a learning community can be part of being more active in the learning process. In this way, students can learn from/with each other. Wouldn't you agree?",116,learning
Also okay! A bit overwhelmed with all the projects and stuff,116,generic
although that part of extra activities requires a lot of logistical effort and I am not sure if all of them could actually attendd those activities.,116,generic
"Although, one has to be careful with the information sources. As well as their sequence etc.",116,generic
and I am not sure that is always true,116,generic
"and i think it is problematic to control where does learners spend their learning time when they are in webpages like facebook. I mean, for some it could work really well, but i am sure that many could get distracted easily",116,learning
"As Ms.Allen said, it's bette to explain important things!",116,generic
"As she said ""the more flasher the merrier""! The more interesting and eye-catching presentations are, the more students would be interested in the material and stay awake during them!",116,generic
"but anyways, here we are",116,generic
"But I also found that collaboration can be difficult through digital tools that are used. Facing technical issues can hinder learning  in this context, and affect collaborating task performance.",116,learning
"but in my experience, i have found that to be helpful. specially during these corona times.",116,generic
Definetly. when people uses more energy on trying to figure out how the tool is supposed to work instead on the task it self the cognitive load is too harf and there might be a lost of motivation and feelings of frustration,116,transmission
Do you both agree with the following statement: Descriptive feedback contains specific information. Why?,116,transmission
Do you both agree with the following statement: Feedback refers to transmission of information about learner performance. Why?,116,transmission
Do you both agree with the following statement: Learning activities refers to learning opportunity. Why?,116,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: Orchestration refers to teacher interventions. Why?,116,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: Scaffolding refers to support. Why?,116,transmission
Do you both agree with the following statement: Technology refers to tools. Why?,116,technology
Do you think collaborative learning can be enhanced or negatively affected using SM?,116,learning
Do you think flipped classroom would be a good approach in this scenario?,116,interactivity
Exactly,116,generic
"Exactly! If not all, most students at the moment use some SM platform which has an impact on their daily lives.",116,technology
"Exactly, the motivation might get affected by it and it may also affect the learning outcomes",116,learning
Exactly.,116,generic
Exactly. Change is inevitable after all and as educators we need to find ways to incorporate new tools in our teaching methods.,116,learning
Good point! Instructions play a significant role in such approaches,116,learning
Good point. I think it's best when questionnaires are to be filled in the start of the courses to figure out the students' needs.,116,interactivity
Great!,116,generic
Great! Thank you for this discussions! see you next week :),116,generic
Great! yeah our time is over!,116,generic
Haha yes that's true! In real life scenarios there's more aspects to consider which in this case time efficiency is a realistic aspect,116,generic
hahaha true,116,generic
"hahaha, I think we have different opinions here",116,generic
Have a good evening! :D,116,generic
Have a nice day :D,116,generic
Hello! I am here :),116,generic
Hello!!,116,generic
"Hello, I am online as well. I'm doing okay and how are you?",116,generic
"Hello, I am online. How are you?",116,generic
Hi there! How's it going? :),116,generic
"Hi, I am here",116,generic
Hmm could you explain your point of view on this?,116,generic
How are you doing today?,116,generic
How are you?,116,generic
how do you think they can implement technologies without going to extremes?,116,technology
"How would you think a learning community could be build in this case? I was thinking, building a learning community within the course but also outside of it would be beneficial for their learning outcomes.",116,learning
"however, I think there is a lot of content arownd that is less intellectually challenging and many people comsumes that",116,learning
however... she say the more and flashier the merrier,116,generic
I agree,116,generic
I agree this is frustrating as well. Also for the students it can be demotivating when they are not sure what exactly is wrong with their answer.,116,generic
I agree with the statement. Orchestration is a combination of various teaching approaches.,116,learning
"I agree with what you said, it's rather common for courses to rely on simple presentations. I believe that using one source of information is not likely not interesting for the students.",116,
"I agree with you as well. I think it's important for the students to feel involved in the learning process, as their motivation can change as well.",116,learning
"I agree with you! It depends on the level of expertise of learners, both with technology and with the topic at hand.",116,technology
"I agree with you! It would be distracting to use SM (the example like the Facebook group that Ms.Wells has done), specially when most students already use the app for entertainment purposes.",116,representation
I agree with you. It is important in these contexts to consider the best learning setting that would lead to positive learning outcomes. We should also consider that using SM can be more engaging to the students which would affect their motivation as well.,116,interactivity
"I agree with you. SM can be used in blended learning/ flipped classrooms as well! Specially in distance learning, students can stay connected to each other and have a sense of belonging when using SM in this context.",116,interactivity
I agree!,116,generic
"I agree, particularly when it is Informative or descriptive feedback, where it is focused on how the student performed more than whch grade he/she obtained",116,transmission
"I agree, specially for learniners in the new generations, who interact a lot in SM",116,learning
"I agree, that is actually aa great problem to solve for educational researchers: Teaching how to teach",116,generic
I agree. Including examples would be helpful for providing example answers which are more helpful.,116,generic
"I also think his way of thinking might be a bit out-dated. Social interactions are becoming different, but that does not has to be something bad",116,generic
I also think that using animations and interactive questions/quizzes in the video presentations would be beneficial for the students. Maybe directing them to interact with other members of the learning community to answer said quizzes as well.,116,interactivity
I also think... Ideally educators should ask the students in which way they would like to learn. or at least present different options,116,learning
I am doing okay :),116,generic
I do agree with it.  The aim of learning arrangements is that the student learns in a effective way,116,learning
I do agree with that. Orchestration is the correct combination of teacher interventions,116,learning
"I don't agree with her approach. I believe students are less likely to understand their mistakes and improve in their future when they don't learn from their mistakes. As the app only has feedback that indicates solely that the answer is not correct, students won't know what exactly is wrong with their answer.",116,transmission
I don't agree with Ms.Wells either. It would be hard to disgard all the benefits that come from FTF classes and support the argument that online learning alone can be superior.,116,learning
"I don't think always the more the merrier. If a professor is going to share with the students a lot of multimedia material without a previous explanation, or maybe without giving the students the chance to interact, or actually get engaged, then the multimedia material might be irrelevant as well",116,media
I find relevant to mention the part when they say that Prof. Smith does not know how to change and that he thinks what he is doing works,116,generic
I guess our time is over,116,generic
"I guess that is why orchestration is so important. In a context where people are new to digital interfaces, a good aproach is to start with something that does not requre so much effort in that regard",116,learning
I see your point! Maybe attending virtual cost-free events would be an affordable and engaging experience for all of them.,116,virtual
I think flipped classroom is a really good strategy. It is important to consider the quality of the material to review at home,116,interactivity
"I think it could be built by encoraging students use alternative tools to communicate after class such as social media... Or maybe making them experience activities that are not usually part of the ""classroom activities"" like going to a museum, or a cultural activity",116,media
I think it depends on the context and expertice of the users,116,generic
"I think Mr. Heineken has the wrong idea about social media, a bit out-dated even. I don't think that SM can be that detrimental to social interactions or be less intellectually challenging.",116,media
"I think there can be learning communities that form in such platforms (FB, instagram etc.). I have used both for language learning or building/learning a new skill!",116,learning
I think tools like forums are a useful tool,116,generic
"I think using SM as a communication channel is a good start to implementing them. It can be helpful for learners and teachers to communicate through them, either by having discussions there or coordinating group assignments.",116,interactivity
I totally agree. That would make the process more learner-centered and the technology-centered,116,technology
I understand! Having a schedule to work through everything in time helps!,116,generic
I would complement that saying that it could be more efficient and it allows to students who cannot attend to the class to get feedback aswerll,116,transmission
I'm doing okay! and how are you?,116,generic
I'm doing okay! And how are you?? :),116,generic
I'm good too,116,generic
In that way the student would click on it only if he actually needs the explanation. Since sometimes students make typos or silly mistakes that were not intended but get all the feedback as if they did not understand the topic,116,transmission
"In the digital era, of course, there are many digital technological inventions, and many can be used as tools for learning",116,learning
Indicating which answers are correct/wrong shouldn't be about time efficiency but about the improving learning results and achieving learning goals.,116,learning
"It also depends on the kind of tools used, its design and functionality",116,generic
it demands training,116,generic
"It is funny how in theory one can find the right solution easily but in real life, there are so many extraneous factors influencing the teaching-learning processes",116,learning
It may be affected I mean.,116,generic
It was an interesting conversation. Thank you!,116,generic
its not only about only using digital tools or face to face arrangement but to find the correct combination to achieve better learning outcomes,116,learning
Like promote somhow informal learning through that learning community?,116,learning
maybe he haas not found the way to allow or facilitate interactions,116,interactivity
Maybe if she does not want to desply the correct answer at least should share an explanation of why the chosen option was not correct,116,generic
meanlike finding  a point in the middle,116,generic
Ms allen says that it would be better to explain things directly. What would you say to her to convince her about digitall feedback ?,116,transmission
"Not at the point to stop doing face to face classes, like ms Wells says, but adapting to new tools is imortant",116,generic
"Of course there are many great resources on the internet and impressive learning communities, but that is not the most popular thing about social media platforms like facebook or instagram, for rxample",116,interactivity
"of course with every differnt type of learning arrengement there is an inherent opportunity of learning. Maybe some are better than others, but the opportunity is always there",116,learning
"Oh yes, that helps a lot1",116,generic
"Oh, yes it is. Thanks !!",116,generic
"okay, read you next week :) Thanks for the discussion!",116,generic
"On the other hand, the suggestion from Ms. Doe is more preferable. I agree with her, as multimedia presentations that contain different sources of information are more engaging.",116,media
"On the other side, Ms Allen position is not better either",116,generic
One god thing about the professor in this example is that he encorages his students to learn together,116,generic
Other good ways beside SM could be blended learning or flipped classroom approaches,116,interactivity
"Our time is up! I believe we have agreed to most points covered, wouldn't you agree?",116,generic
Our time is up! Thank you for the interesting and fun discussions! :),116,generic
Pointing out the mistakes and explaining why its the first thing. providing support and examples as well,116,generic
Seems like we are on the same page then!,116,generic
Shall we start discussing the topic?,116,generic
should we start discussing the topic?,116,generic
So how do you think Ms.Brown would design effective feedback using technology?,116,transmission
So maybe one way to use multimedia tools would be to discuss with students their needs,116,media
So students don't lose motivation and also reflect on the topic,116,generic
So what do you think of Ms Brown approach?,116,generic
So what do you think of Prof. Smith and Ms. Doe?,116,generic
"sorry, I meant: than technology-centered*",116,technology
sure. So a good way to provide better feedback using technology would be providing scaffolding according to the learniner necessities,116,technology
Thank you for the interesting discussion! See you next week! :),116,generic
"That could be part of it, yes! Maybe forming a learning community using social media and encourage students to interact more within the learning community that has already been built.",116,media
"That is a good point. There are mostly questionaries to assess the knowledge of students, but not so often to assess what are their particular needs t o learn better",116,interactivity
"That is true. It shouldn't be about time efficiency. However, I've found so many educators that have to affront so many time constraints because of their workload...",116,learning
that support can decrease in frequency or intensity as the time goes by and the student learns,116,learning
That's a good point! It provides more accessibility!,116,learning
That's a good point. A lot of resources on available on SM platforms are not accurate or contribute to learning benefits.,116,learning
"That's also true! Sometimes it's about saving time from one action, to invest more time to something different - which in this case it could be spending more time explaining the answers without the use of the app.",116,learning
Thats right... maybe she can find a way to manage her time efficiently while also giving better feedback to the students,116,transmission
That's true. I think it should be based on students' level of knowledge and skills,116,transmission
There are benefits in both but I would emphasize the importance of student engagement as one of the main benefits in digital feedback!,116,transmission
"Well, I think this situation is actually really common in classrooms. I think Ms. Doe is doing a good job by teliling the porfessor that domething could be done better",116,interactivity
what do you think?,116,generic
What do you think?,116,generic
What do you think?,116,generic
What do you think?,116,generic
what do yout think about the case?,116,generic
"When the student takes active part in the leaarning process usually there are better results, I agree with you",116,learning
Wow! external links with audios are a great idea,116,generic
yeah!,116,generic
"Yeah, thats true. There are presentations everywhere and some of them are simply boring",116,generic
yes exactly!! we've all had hard times with self-regulation even as expert learners haha,116,learning
"Yes I agree with the statement, as technology can refer to digital tools or tools as means to achieve digital outcomes.",116,technology
"Yes I agree with the statement. Descriptive feedback may contain specific strengths/weaknesses of students, as well as future suggestions for improvement.",116,transmission
"Yes I agree with the statement. I believe that feedback is related to learners' performance, as well as information about the knowledge in case of misinterpretations.",116,transmission
Yes I agree with the statemnt. Learning activities are opportunities for students to explore a topic more deeply in a benefiting manner.,116,learning
"Yes I agree with you! It's quite often that novice users of digital tools spend more cognitive resources figuring out how to navigate the tools, instead of focusing at the task at hand.",116,learning
Yes I agree!,116,generic
"Yes I agree! A more learner-centered approach is needed in this case, because as it was reported by the students; they tend to look for other sources of information for this course.",116,learning
Yes I also find Ms Allen's opinion better than Ms. Brown's. I don't agree with her justification to be honest,116,generic
Yes I believe it's relevant as well within this context. It is likely his lack of skills and familiarity with new technologies that lead him to create/ use such presentations.,116,technology
Yes it could be beneficial for users to review material but also it's important to consider that learners have to regulate their own learning which can be difficult for novice learners.,116,learning
Yes it's important to have good scaffolding especially when using technlogy.,116,technology
"Yes I've also found that using technology can be extremely helpful, especially considering the abundance of available resources.",116,technology
Yes sure,116,generic
Yes sure!,116,generic
Yes! It seems that the students are used to work/learn in groups by now. I agree with you it seems that their interactions may be limited.,116,interactivity
yes! Sometimes people refers to technology only when is a digital thing.But there are also other types of technolgy that are not digital such as a notebook and a pen,116,technology
"Yes, assessing learners' needs would be a step of that process. Additionally, following the multimedia principles to provide such content that results in positive learning outcomes.",116,media
"yes, descriptive feedback gives informtion on each of the students/groups/projects",116,transmission
"Yes, descriptive feedback in particular offers more insight into students' performance.",116,transmission
"Yes, exactly! Sometimes it can be as simple as misclicking even so the students should be able to choose what type of explanation is needed for their wrong asnwers",116,transmission
"Yes, I agree with the statement. Scaffolding works as support directly from the educators to the students and should also include guidelines.",116,transmission
"Yes, I think interactive multimedia resources are a better option",116,interactivity
"Yes, I think the sense of belonging might be important for many in the sense that it might play a role in motivation and engagement",116,generic
"yes, it reffers to support that the teacher gives to the student",116,generic
"yes, sometimes self-regulation is difficult even for people who know the theory about it! xD",116,learning
"yes, that is true!",116,generic
"Yes, the sequence and the way to display the information without overwhelming the student are. important",116,transmission
"yes, there are such types of learning communities in those platforms, but what i mean is that there is also a lot of content that does not contribute to learning at all",116,learning
"Yes, unfortunately most questionnaires heavily focus on assessing prior knowledge rather than students' needs. I believe it's beneficial when needs' assessment takes place, as the students can take active part in the learning process, rather than passively participate.",116,learning
Yes. Also applying better the scaffolding techniques,116,transmission
You make a good point! I think the students should be engaged in the learning process. Do you think creating interactive multimedia presentations is a better solution?,116,media
You make a good point! It's preferrable for the students to know what makes the correct answer good and it's even better than actually correcting their wrong answer.,116,generic
you're right. That would be a good solution,116,generic
"Hello, I am online. How are you?",116,generic
"Hello, I am online as well. I'm doing okay and how are you?",116,generic
I am doing okay :),116,generic

Agree with you. I personally find that methodology incredibly frustrating.,116,generic
Maybe if she does not want to desply the correct answer at least should share an explanation of why the chosen option was not correct,116,generic
So students don't lose motivation and also reflect on the topic,116,generic
I agree this is frustrating as well. Also for the students it can be demotivating when they are not sure what exactly is wrong with their answer.,116,generic
Exactly.,116,generic

Pointing out the mistakes and explaining why its the first thing. providing support and examples as well,116,transmission
I agree. Including examples would be helpful for providing example answers which are more helpful.,116,transmission
Yes. Also applying better the scaffolding techniques,116,transmission
Do you both agree with the following statement: Scaffolding refers to support. Why?,116,transmission
Yes it's important to have good scaffolding especially when using technlogy.,116,transmission
"yes, it reffers to support that the teacher gives to the student",116,transmission
"Yes, I agree with the statement. Scaffolding works as support directly from the educators to the students and should also include guidelines.",116,transmission
that support can decrease in frequency or intensity as the time goes by and the student learns,116,transmission
That's true. I think it should be based on students' level of knowledge and skills,116,transmission
sure. So a good way to provide better feedback using technology would be providing scaffolding according to the learniner necessities,116,transmission
Yes I agree!,116,generic
Also I think that explanatory answers should be embedded as pop-up options that students can click on and find out more. Maybe even including external links or audio explanations of the correct answers.,116,transmission
Wow! external links with audios are a great idea,116,generic
In that way the student would click on it only if he actually needs the explanation. Since sometimes students make typos or silly mistakes that were not intended but get all the feedback as if they did not understand the topic,116,transmission
"As Ms.Allen said, it's bette to explain important things!",116,generic
agree with that,116,generic
"Yes, exactly! Sometimes it can be as simple as misclicking even so the students should be able to choose what type of explanation is needed for their wrong asnwers",116,generic
Ms allen says that it would be better to explain things directly. What would you say to her to convince her about digitall feedback ?,116,transmission
There are benefits in both but I would emphasize the importance of student engagement as one of the main benefits in digital feedback!,116,transmission
I would complement that saying that it could be more efficient and it allows to students who cannot attend to the class to get feedback aswerll,116,transmission
That's a good point! It provides more accessibility!,116,generic
yeah!,116,generic
I guess our time is over,116,generic
Great! yeah our time is over!,116,generic
Thank you for the interesting discussion! See you next week! :),116,generic
"okay, read you next week :) Thanks for the discussion!",116,generic
Hi there! How's it going? :),116,generic
"Hi, I am here",116,generic
Great!,116,generic
How are you?,116,generic
I'm doing okay! and how are you?,116,generic
I'm good too,116,generic
what do yout think about the case?,116,generic
"I think Mr. Heineken has the wrong idea about social media, a bit out-dated even. I don't think that SM can be that detrimental to social interactions or be less intellectually challenging.",116,interactivity
What do you think?,116,generic
"I also think his way of thinking might be a bit out-dated. Social interactions are becoming different, but that does not has to be something bad",116,interactivity
"however, I think there is a lot of content arownd that is less intellectually challenging and many people comsumes that",116,interactivity
"Of course there are many great resources on the internet and impressive learning communities, but that is not the most popular thing about social media platforms like facebook or instagram, for rxample",116,interactivity
Exactly. Change is inevitable after all and as educators we need to find ways to incorporate new tools in our teaching methods.,116,interactivity
"yes, that is true!",116,generic
"Not at the point to stop doing face to face classes, like ms Wells says, but adapting to new tools is imortant",116,interactivity
"I think there can be learning communities that form in such platforms (FB, instagram etc.). I have used both for language learning or building/learning a new skill!",116,learning
I don't agree with Ms.Wells either. It would be hard to disgard all the benefits that come from FTF classes and support the argument that online learning alone can be superior.,116,learning
"yes, there are such types of learning communities in those platforms, but what i mean is that there is also a lot of content that does not contribute to learning at all",116,learning
"and i think it is problematic to control where does learners spend their learning time when they are in webpages like facebook. I mean, for some it could work really well, but i am sure that many could get distracted easily",116,learning
That's a good point. A lot of resources on available on SM platforms are not accurate or contribute to learning benefits.,116,learning
"I agree with you! It would be distracting to use SM (the example like the Facebook group that Ms.Wells has done), specially when most students already use the app for entertainment purposes.",116,interactivity
how do you think they can implement technologies without going to extremes?,116,technology
meanlike finding  a point in the middle,116,generic
"I think using SM as a communication channel is a good start to implementing them. It can be helpful for learners and teachers to communicate through them, either by having discussions there or coordinating group assignments.",116,interactivity
What do you think?,116,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Orchestration refers to teacher interventions. Why?,116,learning
I think tools like forums are a useful tool,116,learning
I do agree with that. Orchestration is the correct combination of teacher interventions,116,learning
I agree with the statement. Orchestration is a combination of various teaching approaches.,116,learning
its not only about only using digital tools or face to face arrangement but to find the correct combination to achieve better learning outcomes,116,learning
I agree with you. It is important in these contexts to consider the best learning setting that would lead to positive learning outcomes. We should also consider that using SM can be more engaging to the students which would affect their motivation as well.,116,learning
"I agree, specially for learniners in the new generations, who interact a lot in SM",116,generic
"Exactly! If not all, most students at the moment use some SM platform which has an impact on their daily lives.",116,interactivity
Do you both agree with the following statement: Learning activities refers to learning opportunity. Why?,116,learning
Other good ways beside SM could be blended learning or flipped classroom approaches,116,interactivity
I do agree with it.  The aim of learning arrangements is that the student learns in a effective way,116,learning
"of course with every differnt type of learning arrengement there is an inherent opportunity of learning. Maybe some are better than others, but the opportunity is always there",116,learning
Yes I agree with the statemnt. Learning activities are opportunities for students to explore a topic more deeply in a benefiting manner.,116,learning
"I agree with you. SM can be used in blended learning/ flipped classrooms as well! Specially in distance learning, students can stay connected to each other and have a sense of belonging when using SM in this context.",116,interactivity
"Yes, I think the sense of belonging might be important for many in the sense that it might play a role in motivation and engagement",116,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: Technology refers to tools. Why?,116,technology
"Yes I agree with the statement, as technology can refer to digital tools or tools as means to achieve digital outcomes.",116,learning
yes! Sometimes people refers to technology only when is a digital thing.But there are also other types of technolgy that are not digital such as a notebook and a pen,116,technology
Do you think collaborative learning can be enhanced or negatively affected using SM?,116,learning
"In the digital era, of course, there are many digital technological inventions, and many can be used as tools for learning",116,learning
I think it depends on the context and expertice of the users,116,learning
"I agree with you! It depends on the level of expertise of learners, both with technology and with the topic at hand.",116,technology
"but in my experience, i have found that to be helpful. specially during these corona times.",116,generic
"Yes I've also found that using technology can be extremely helpful, especially considering the abundance of available resources.",116,technology
"It also depends on the kind of tools used, its design and functionality",116,technology
"But I also found that collaboration can be difficult through digital tools that are used. Facing technical issues can hinder learning  in this context, and affect collaborating task performance.",116,learning
Do you think flipped classroom would be a good approach in this scenario?,116,interactivity
Definetly. when people uses more energy on trying to figure out how the tool is supposed to work instead on the task it self the cognitive load is too harf and there might be a lost of motivation and feelings of frustration,116,transmission
I think flipped classroom is a really good strategy. It is important to consider the quality of the material to review at home,116,interactivity
"Yes I agree with you! It's quite often that novice users of digital tools spend more cognitive resources figuring out how to navigate the tools, instead of focusing at the task at hand.",116,transmission
Yes it could be beneficial for users to review material but also it's important to consider that learners have to regulate their own learning which can be difficult for novice learners.,116,learning
"I guess that is why orchestration is so important. In a context where people are new to digital interfaces, a good aproach is to start with something that does not requre so much effort in that regard",116,learning
Good point! Instructions play a significant role in such approaches,116,generic
"yes, sometimes self-regulation is difficult even for people who know the theory about it! xD",116,generic
it demands training,116,generic
yes exactly!! we've all had hard times with self-regulation even as expert learners haha,116,generic
Our time is up! Thank you for the interesting and fun discussions! :),116,generic
hahaha true,116,generic
"Oh, yes it is. Thanks !!",116,generic
Have a nice day :D,116,generic

and also linking learning arrangements with emerging learning objects,115,learning
Are we waiting for the next question? Or can we discuss the main task?,115,generic
are you there ?,115,generic
"As for the second question, I think there are moments in which the appearance of correct answers is not necessary. For example, in homework, you can only show incorrect answers and give students a chance to correct them, this will encourage students to study the misunderstood questions again and better understand the topic. However, if this is the final test, then in this case it is better to show the answers immediately, since the final test does not imply the possibility of redoing some tasks.",115,learning

Are you still typing?,114,generic
arrgh,114,generic
"as yes, that'S a good point with the intentional communication!",114,generic
"bascially I would agree with you. I had an additional thought: Evaluative feedback could, if given graduatedly Idon't know if that's a word), i.e. given with different grades: So you get good, very good, acceptable and stuff like that. This could give you at least in indication how far away from the best possible answer you are. Sometimes that's hard to recognize with descriptive feedback, because both for bad answers and good answers, you might get two points to improve, because you might not be able to improve from bad to very good right away. Does this make sense?",114,transmission
But I agree with you that inverventions is the wrong word,114,transmission
but I like you're idea of scaffolding. letting them run off and giving them a bit of a direction are two things,114,transmission
But it is also revelant which subjects he teaches because this method might not be suitabel to physics,114,transmission

I agree with you. And Ms. Doe can also help him. The problem with many resources could be that student get overstrained. I sometimes feel lost with too many different things,114,generic

I think I have a pretty good idea now of what he could do. You too?,114,generic
"I think I would make it depending on the number of people who got it wrong. the more get it wrong, the more we discuss in class. The thing is: the task doesn't allow for reasoning on the students side. They are just choosing an answer and they can't explain why they chose it. So giving descriptive feedback without knowing why they went there in the first place doesn't make sense to me. So I guess, I would try to figure out in class where students went wrong and then explain descriptively how to do better",114,transmission
"I think it doesn't really, but it could. It is two-way in a sense the one gives something and the other also gives something. But after this one exchange, it kinda stops in my mind. Unless you do more iterations",114,transmission
"I think it would take really good scripting or AI ti make this work. Possibly there some most common mistakes and for that descriptive feedback could be scripted. you can maybe only do so many things wrong when adding numbers together for example? But it would be very hard for other contexts, I agree",114,transmission
"I think it's always difficult to have you r opinion this decidedly on one end of the spectrum. Ms. Wells feels like a  person who thinks she can do anything digitally now because it is the new thing, the new magic. But I think that might not work out that well. Maybe not just yet. The facebook group seems nice, but it could also go sideqys with the data protection and all, students not having non-personal accounts and the like. What do you think?",114,transmission
"I think so to do. In general, their ideas are right but Ms Doe has to ""reduce"" it a bit and Prof Smith should think a bit more modern and ""form"" his idea",114,generic
"I think so, too. Enough ideas :D",114,generic
"I thnk it's open till 09:00 ^^ but yeah, for my brain it kinda is :D Do you want to discuss anything else?",114,generic

I was hoped to be matched with a friend and it is only three times :D It will be alright.,114,generic
"I would not give descriptive feedback on the device because it would be indeed to time consuming for the teacher and not possible for the machine.

no feedback,114,transmission
no feedback for the individual but for everyone regardless of their answer,114,transmission
"No, not really, we could try to answer Jane but nothing else",114,generic

"No, you are right. It should not be up to them what they watch",114,generic
no. I was about to go back to the task: So how would you approach the problem? Give a right or wrong answer and then discuss in class or give descriptive feedback to everyone on their device?,114,transmission
Not assigning tasks but encouring them to deal with the content. I think this is the right idea,114,transmission
Not really because the system cannot give descriptive feedback on its own. Ms Brown needs to invest some time then and write the feedback. I don't know,114,transmission
Oh :D,114,generic
oh no! :(,114,generic
"Oh, I sent it",114,generic
"oh, I thought I prompted you to go first and you gave the ball right back to me :) I thought that was smart sneaky. Nothing else",114,generic
"Oh, sorry :D",114,generic
"Oh, why did you choose this time? :D",114,generic
"Oh, yes, peer feedback. Sure, but they also need clear guidance. And the problem is that students who give feedback sometimes have not understodd the topic and are not good at writing descriptive feedback",114,transmission
Okay,114,generic

Or what experience did you have with peer feedback?,114,generic
Or why are you laughing? I confused the terms,114,generic

shall we leave it at that then?,114,generic
shall we leave it?,114,generic
shall we move onto task 2?,114,generic
So how does Prof Smith solve this.,114,generic
"So, do you have any ideas about how to improve it?",114,generic
"So, for me, intervention has a negative connotation. So, I partly agree because, as far as I understood, orchestration is more like supporting and scaffolding learning activities.",114,learning
"So, have we answered Jane's question completely or would you like to add something?",114,generic
"SO, I don't really get the last sentence of the description",114,generic
"So, technically he is already using some media, right? Presentation slides. To pimp them up he could use pictures (hard in philosophy, but who knows what he teaches). He could also integrate links to other materials, such as blogs, learning videos and stuff. THat's of course a lot of work for him.  He could also outsource that to his students who know their way around the internet better I suppose and just provide a platform where everything is shared and he srt of moderates and evaluates there what his students post and upvotes the good stuff they found or explanations they give.",114,media
"So, the system gives evaluative feedback at first, then based on the class feedback, the teacher gives descriptive feedback?",114,transmission
So. Where shall we start?,114,generic
"Some multimedia principles should be considered, not overloading slides, only using colors for the coding principle, for example.",114,media
"Something like "" Is typing""",114,generic
sometimes it doesn't send my messages either :((,114,generic

That's an interseting though with the opportinities directed to motivation and regulation. Maybe also at social interactions,114,interactivity
The faster sentence?,114,generic
The problem is that machines (now) cannot give descriptive feedback. Or can you imahÂ´gine that?,114,generic

wbu?,114,generic
we need more emojis in this chat...,114,generic
"Well, I agree with neither of them",114,generic
"Well, I somehow agree with Mr Heineken because this is the current situation for students in the pandemic. The problem is that other possibilties are missing. So, of course, you should not only use media but combine it. And you can certainly be engaged with intellectual content if you choose the right sources",114,media
"Well, I think that evaluative feedback does not refer to a measure of feedback because it does nor describe why a person has done something correct or not. Just saying ""Good!"" is not descriptive or constructive and can even be superficial.",114,transmission
"Well, sure it can but might require more scaffolding for younger students than in face-to-face classes.",114,transmission
what are your ideas? :),114,generic
What do you exactly mean? The system gives feedback or they use a platform to communicate?,114,transmission
What do you think about MS. Wells?,114,generic

"yeah, I guess :D",114,generic
"yeah, like ms. brown thinks she is saving time for herself so she can explain thinngs more properly, but just above it says, that ms. allen is all for explaining it directly, so ms. brown is not?

"Yes, you are right. Media must be combined with a method. Wasn't this mentioned in the videos? Not exactly like that maybe :D",114,media
You are right that they are socialising a lot online. But that does not replace real physical contacts. And younger students in school have more problems in school and have not learned that much. The problem here is orchestration might also require self-regulation and social skills to work in groups that younger students might not have,114,learning
"You are right, a bit weird. I thought that Ms. Brown does not want to indicate why it is wrong because it saves time. Ms Allen is in the same opinion that feedback should be given in class.

"Hm, maybe his idea to assign tasks to students. Although I think they do no necessarily need to be group tasks",114,generic
Not assigning tasks but encouring them to deal with the content. I think this is the right idea,114,generic
"and then scaffolding this, so they don't drift off, as you already said, as an improvement. I think this could work",114,transmission
shall we move onto task 2?,114,generic
"Yes, I think so. Or is there anything else you agree with?",114,generic
"hmm, I think I mentioned everything. I mean, there might be some worth in his teaching so far. You'd have to look at it to evaluate that, and multimedia presentatioins *are* indeed state-of-the-art I suppose, and a bit more modern. So if the students just said goodbye because they wanted to watch youtube videos just because the old version seemed dusty, then well... you still gotta adapt to the learners, but if the material is still all right.. it might just need other media. Still, method could also be adapted",114,media
"I think so to do. In general, their ideas are right but Ms Doe has to ""reduce"" it a bit and Prof Smith should think a bit more modern and ""form"" his idea",114,generic
yes!!,114,generic
So how does Prof Smith solve this.,114,generic
"So, do you have any ideas about how to improve it?",114,generic
:D,114,generic
lol,114,generic
"Oh, sorry :D",114,generic
okay. lemme think.,114,generic
don't worry :D that's the problem of not seeing the typing,114,generic
"So, technically he is already using some media, right? Presentation slides. To pimp them up he could use pictures (hard in philosophy, but who knows what he teaches). He could also integrate links to other materials, such as blogs, learning videos and stuff. THat's of course a lot of work for him.  He could also outsource that to his students who know their way around the internet better I suppose and just provide a platform where everything is shared and he srt of moderates and evaluates there what his students post and upvotes the good stuff they found or explanations they give.",114,media
I agree with you. And Ms. Doe can also help him. The problem with many resources could be that student get overstrained. I sometimes feel lost with too many different things,114,generic
good point!,114,generic
I forgot about Ms. Doe ':D,114,generic
what are your ideas? :),114,generic
"He could also try to flip it around and assign tasks to students in the classroom. He could provide scaffolding and discuss the tasks. At home students should read and watch about the content. But still, the content must be presented in a good way. Or he could try to integrate good external videos",114,transmission
"ah flipped classroom, nice. Then it'S totally their choice what they watch and he gets some interaction back. Would you use a tool for that?",114,interactivity
But it is also revelant which subjects he teaches because this method might not be suitabel to physics,114,generic
"No, you are right. It should not be up to them what they watch",114,generic
"hm.. I mean if he controls the outcome again with some classroom interaction and corrects them, it could be their choice.",114,interactivity
but I like you're idea of scaffolding. letting them run off and giving them a bit of a direction are two things,114,generic
"might also be hard to handle for him. and possibly also for ms. doe. if she's so idealising and the students then make it not according to her plan, she will be annoyed too",114,generic
"Ah, okay. Then it could be okay. The problem is that you cannot judge videos' correctness if you are a novice learner",114,generic
I think I have a pretty good idea now of what he could do. You too?,114,generic
"I think so, too. Enough ideas :D",114,generic
"yes, totally. I think we would need more info about his subjects to plan further into that direction :/",114,generic
all right *_* cool,114,generic
shall we leave it at that then?,114,generic
"Yes, you are right. And about the size of the group, time etc...",114,generic
+,114,generic
"Yes, leave it :) Thanks for the discussion",114,generic
Same to you :) I think we did well.,114,generic
Do you if the messages are saved here?,114,generic
Would be great to reread them for the assignment but I don't want to make so many screenshots :D,114,generic
"yes, they are. We can go back and read them, if we need them again. I don't know whether they stay till the next time, but until we have to hand in for sure",114,generic
"Okay, perfect :)",114,generic
see you probably next wednesday ;),114,generic
See you :),114,generic
good morning,114,generic
Hey :),114,generic
hi :),114,generic
how is it going?,114,generic
I am doing okay :) And you?,114,generic
I,114,generic
I'm okay too :) Let#s get this thing on the road.,114,generic
Allen vs Brown ^^,114,generic
Yep,114,generic
"SO, I don't really get the last sentence of the description",114,generic
"Okay, you can start and I wait if it is okay :)",114,generic
The faster sentence?,114,generic
":D that problem again. okay, I'll describe...",114,generic
"yeah, like ms. brown thinks she is saving time for herself so she can explain thinngs more properly, but just above it says, that ms. allen is all for explaining it directly, so ms. brown is not? So why does she need more time? Is she not giving feedback on the device, but still explaining the right answer in class after asking everyone? How did you understand it?",114,transmission
Do you both agree with the following statement: Feedback refers to transmission of information about learner performance. Why?,114,transmission
"You are right, a bit weird. I thought that Ms. Brown does not want to indicate why it is wrong because it saves time. Ms Allen is in the same opinion that feedback should be given in class. She even does not want to give descriptive feedback. I think that is the difference between the two of them",114,transmission
"Uh, I don't know how to proceed :/ Answering this question or discussing our aspect...",114,generic
Let's discuss what feedback would make sense and why/why not. We have,114,generic
no feedback,114,transmission
evaluative feedback,114,transmission
descriptive feedback,114,transmission
evaluative feedback,114,transmission
and,114,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Evaluative feedback refers to measure of quality. Why?,114,transmission
no feedback for the individual but for everyone regardless of their answer,114,transmission
or we just answer jane...,114,generic
^^,114,generic
:D,114,generic
Answering the second question?,114,generic
I,114,generic
"yeah, I guess :D",114,generic
You or I? :D,114,generic
you go this time :D,114,generic
Okay,114,generic
"Well, I think that evaluative feedback does not refer to a measure of feedback because it does nor describe why a person has done something correct or not. Just saying ""Good!"" is not descriptive or constructive and can even be superficial.",114,transmission
"And just ""Wrong"" won't lead to a better quality next time",114,generic
Done :),114,generic
":) okay, i go",114,generic
"bascially I would agree with you. I had an additional thought: Evaluative feedback could, if given graduatedly Idon't know if that's a word), i.e. given with different grades: So you get good, very good, acceptable and stuff like that. This could give you at least in indication how far away from the best possible answer you are. Sometimes that's hard to recognize with descriptive feedback, because both for bad answers and good answers, you might get two points to improve, because you might not be able to improve from bad to very good right away. Does this make sense?",114,transmission
Do you both agree with the following statement: Descriptive feedback contains specific information. Why?,114,transmission
"You are right, it makes sense",114,generic
heavens,114,generic
@jane I meant,114,generic
"okay, phew :D I was afraid I was babbling",114,generic
"okay, phew :D I was afraid I was babbling",114,generic
@Jane we are in the middle of a discussion :/,114,generic
wth,114,generic
xD,114,generic
xD,114,generic
"hm, now my message disappeared",114,generic
and I agree. descriptive feedback contains specific information,114,transmission
we need more emojis in this chat...,114,generic
*rolling eyes*,114,generic
Can you see my message?,114,generic
I can see: it makes sense and Jane we are in the middle of a discussion,114,generic
sometimes it doesn't send my messages either :((,114,generic
"Ah, I can't see this one",114,generic
and we need an answer feature. I,114,generic
I,114,generic
arrgh,114,generic
I'm loosing overview,114,generic
"Okay, so I agree with Jane's statement",114,generic
me too,114,generic
"If it is well written, it contains specific information what the learner has done good or bad",114,generic
And how the learner can improve it,114,generic
I agree,114,generic
But it should also not be too much because it is overloading then,114,generic
The problem is that machines (now) cannot give descriptive feedback. Or can you imahÂ´gine that?,114,transmission
*imagine,114,generic
good point! maybe just so much as to get to the next better level.,114,generic
"I think it would take really good scripting or AI ti make this work. Possibly there some most common mistakes and for that descriptive feedback could be scripted. you can maybe only do so many things wrong when adding numbers together for example? But it would be very hard for other contexts, I agree",114,transmission
"So, have we answered Jane's question completely or would you like to add something?",114,generic
no. I was about to go back to the task: So how would you approach the problem? Give a right or wrong answer and then discuss in class or give descriptive feedback to everyone on their device?,114,transmission
"I would not give descriptive feedback on the device because it would be indeed to time consuming for the teacher and not possible for the machine. I would let the system give descriptive feedback about the correct and wrong answers. If there are still problems or questions they could be discussed in class. Or if there is a question that many answered wrong, it could also be discussed in class",114,transmission
How would you do that?,114,generic
:D,114,generic
"Ups, let the system give evaluative feedback",114,transmission
Or why are you laughing? I confused the terms,114,generic
"I think I would make it depending on the number of people who got it wrong. the more get it wrong, the more we discuss in class. The thing is: the task doesn't allow for reasoning on the students side. They are just choosing an answer and they can't explain why they chose it. So giving descriptive feedback without knowing why they went there in the first place doesn't make sense to me. So I guess, I would try to figure out in class where students went wrong and then explain descriptively how to do better",114,transmission
"oh, I thought I prompted you to go first and you gave the ball right back to me :) I thought that was smart sneaky. Nothing else",114,generic
Your approach makes sense :D,114,generic
"So, the system gives evaluative feedback at first, then based on the class feedback, the teacher gives descriptive feedback?",114,transmission
thanks :) do you think this could be realized with technology?,114,technology
What do you exactly mean? The system gives feedback or they use a platform to communicate?,114,transmission
"hmm, more like a platform. I was looking at task two right now. How could the teacher improve it using technology. Do you have an idea?",114,technology
Not really because the system cannot give descriptive feedback on its own. Ms Brown needs to invest some time then and write the feedback. I don't know,114,transmission
"yeah, I agree. :/ maybe also other students could give ffeedback?",114,transmission
"Oh, yes, peer feedback. Sure, but they also need clear guidance. And the problem is that students who give feedback sometimes have not understodd the topic and are not good at writing descriptive feedback",114,transmission
Or what experience did you have with peer feedback?,114,transmission
Also depends on if its anonymous or not,114,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Peer feedback refers to two-way communication process. Why?,114,transmission
"yeah, definitely"" Sometimes I write half a page myself trying to be nice, but clear where I dthink they went wrong and what could be improved and what I get in return is ""Well done. Really liked it."" ...Well, thanks!",114,generic
Sweet Jane...,114,generic
:D Isn't the time over?,114,generic
"I thnk it's open till 09:00 ^^ but yeah, for my brain it kinda is :D Do you want to discuss anything else?",114,generic
"No, not really, we could try to answer Jane but nothing else",114,generic
"OKay, let's do that and then we'll leave it for today :)",114,generic
*Thumbs up*,114,generic
You or I? :D,114,generic
"I think it doesn't really, but it could. It is two-way in a sense the one gives something and the other also gives something. But after this one exchange, it kinda stops in my mind. Unless you do more iterations",114,generic
":D sorry, I just went ahead",114,generic
"I also do not really agree because the first person did not write something with the purpose to communicate with the other person that is giving feedback. And they just communicate once, you are right",114,transmission
"as yes, that'S a good point with the intentional communication!",114,transmission
okay :),114,generic
shall we leave it?,114,generic
Yes,114,generic
Thanks for the discussion :),114,generic
All right. Thanks for the discussion. I'll see you next week :),114,generic
See you :),114,generic
Good morning,114,generic
hello again,114,generic
Let's start right away?,114,generic
perfect,114,generic
You or I? :),114,generic
take the lead :D,114,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Orchestration refers to teacher interventions. Why?,114,learning
..not her again,114,generic
"Okay, then the statement... I deleted my other one",114,generic
oh no! :(,114,generic
"okay, well, interventions is the wrong word I think. Planning would be more suitable.",114,generic
"So, for me, intervention has a negative connotation. So, I partly agree because, as far as I understood, orchestration is more like supporting and scaffolding learning activities.",114,learning
Do you agree with the statement?,114,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Learning activities refers to learning opportunity. Why?,114,learning
"Aah, interesting. What'S negtaive about it for you?                                    I don't agree. THe conductor in an orchestra also doesn't intervene. He leads them through it.",114,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: Learning arrangements refers to learnig resources. Why?,114,learning
Are you still typing?,114,generic
no :D I was waiting for your naswer to my question. is it not there?,114,generic
"Oh, I sent it",114,generic
I typed:,114,generic
"For me, intervention has a negative connotation. So, I partly agree because, as far as I understood, orchestration is more like supporting and scaffolding learning activities",114,learning
Did you get it now?,114,generic
"yes, I read that :D I answered: Aah, interesting. Whatâ€˜S negtaive about it for you? I donâ€˜t agree. THe conductor in an orchestra also doesnâ€˜t intervene. He leads them through it.",114,learning
"Okay, then, I cannot see your message :D",114,generic
"I also wrote: okay, well, interventions is the wrong word I think. Planning would be more suitable."" some time previously if that didn't get through",114,learning
lol,114,generic
I also cannot see this one,114,generic
-.-,114,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Roles refers to roles in classroom. Why?,114,interactivity
But I agree with you that inverventions is the wrong word,114,learning
"Okay, which of Janes question do we want to answer?",114,generic
"uugh, I'm getting annoyed at this.. puufff. Okay, let'S do the 2. with the opportunity",114,generic
"Okay, go on :)",114,generic
"Activities can indeed provide opprtunity to learn, but they could also be about motivation or regulation. So not just ofr direct learning I think.",114,transmission
wbu?,114,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Mobile learning refers to learning with mobile devices. Why?,114,interactivity
That's an interseting though with the opportinities directed to motivation and regulation. Maybe also at social interactions,114,interactivity
yes definitely!,114,generic
I don't know what to do? Answering all these question or going back to the case? We still haven't talked about that at all...,114,generic
I feel let's rather talk about the case so we get Ideas for our assignment?,114,generic
The questions are interesting but too many,114,generic
"Yes, they are interesting but too many and we cannot discuss the case then",114,generic
okay. So what do you think about Mr. Heineken?,114,generic
"Okay, what are your thoughts about the case?",114,generic
Oh :D,114,generic
"Okay, I will type sth",114,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Micro-learning refers to learning with small learning units. Why?,114,learning
"Well, I somehow agree with Mr Heineken because this is the current situation for students in the pandemic. The problem is that other possibilties are missing. So, of course, you should not only use media but combine it. And you can certainly be engaged with intellectual content if you choose the right sources",114,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: Inquiry learning refers to active learning. Why?,114,learning
"I agree with your second part, that there are definitely options out there to do intellectual and chlalenging stuff online. I also think that people are sozializing a lot online. And reading. Yes, of course there are also studies about loneliness due to less face-to-face, but I feel that we managed quite well with the social by this point in the pandemic. At least better than in the beginning and better than ever before.",114,interactivity
Do you both agree with the following statement: Mobile devices are needed for mobile learning. Why?,114,interactivity
You are right that they are socialising a lot online. But that does not replace real physical contacts. And younger students in school have more problems in school and have not learned that much. The problem here is orchestration might also require self-regulation and social skills to work in groups that younger students might not have,114,interactivity
in case you are typing: go on. In case you're not: shall we go on to Ms. wells?,114,generic
ah damn. it didn't load,114,generic
I posted a message at 08:29:13,114,generic
Did you get it?,114,generic
"yes, just saw it :/",114,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Exploratory learning encourages exploration. Why?,114,learning
"hmm, do you think this orchestration can't happen online?",114,learning
"Well, sure it can but might require more scaffolding for younger students than in face-to-face classes.",114,interactivity
agreed.,114,generic
What do you think about MS. Wells?,114,generic
"Do you both agree with the following statement: Augmented Reality refers to, enhanced version of real physical world. Why?",114,augmented
"I think it's always difficult to have you r opinion this decidedly on one end of the spectrum. Ms. Wells feels like a  person who thinks she can do anything digitally now because it is the new thing, the new magic. But I think that might not work out that well. Maybe not just yet. The facebook group seems nice, but it could also go sideqys with the data protection and all, students not having non-personal accounts and the like. What do you think?",114,transmission
Do you both agree with the following statement: Open educational resources are freely accessible resources. Why?,114,learning
I agree with you. Facebook is problematic because of the reasons you wrote. I do not know what to add because have already discussed that when we discussed about Mr Heineken.,114,transmission
Digital learning opportunities only are beneficial if you chose them wisely. But this is the same with other teaching methods,114,learning
Do you have a concrete idea how they could implement digital learning opportunities?,114,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: Blended learning refers to educational approach. Why?,114,interactivity
"yepp, I think you are right. they can offer a lot of new ways of interaction that can also happen during face-to-face. I mean you don't have to be online to be digital. Uuhhm, lemme think of something concrete... thanks Jane :D blended learning. have them be digital at home where they aren't face-to-face anyway with the class, watch videos, read blogs, maybe discuss on Kialo.com and then in class, involve the whole class in the discussion about all that",114,learning
How would you try to include all students also those who are quieter and do not want to speak in front of a group? This is always a problem,114,interactivity
Is there a way to improve this with media?,114,media
"Do you both agree with the following statement: Hybrid learning includes rotation model, flex model. Why?",114,interactivity
"hm, good point. On kialo.com everyone can post. So this also includes those students. I don't think you have to get everyone to speak. I sometimes felt very pushed to speak and it didn't beneift my learning at all. :/ do you have an idea?",114,learning
"No, not really. The problem is that you get a bad grade if you do not speak",114,generic
"hm, yes. I think if you have an online discussion forum it might be easier cause you write and don't speak, whenever you want and it doesn't get drowned out. thus the teacher has something to grade. It's not perfect but it is something",114,interactivity
Do you both agree with the following statement: Media competence is vital for learning with media. Why?,114,media
You are right. Anything else to discuss or do we have enough ideas for the assignment?,114,generic
:D I think I'm good. And you?,114,generic
Me too :),114,generic

about the given case: I think after evaluation it is important to give feedback,113,transmission
Actually I thought we can speak here but we have to write)),113,generic
ah ok,113,generic
alright,113,generic
also could be flipped class as well,113,interactivity
also try to assign individual work as well. Give students feedback which is important,113,transmission
also we could expose positive experience to use social media to conect and present topics and discusions for Ms Heineken classes,113,media
And in our case it's better to give informative feedback. It can be also descriptive but it takes longer time,113,transmission
and you?,113,generic
and you?,113,generic
"because Prof Smith likes group work, but sometimes it has to be invidual work as well",113,generic
because that way the learning process would be more effective,113,learning
Behaviorism focuses on the idea that all behaviors are learned through interaction with the environment.,113,learning
blog is a god idea too,113,generic
but sometimes this informative feedback can be done at the finals question for example,113,transmission
but you meant videos created by the teachres or the students,113,generic
"by use of educational technologies such as ""critical thinking techniques"", ""case studies"", ""jigsaw"". Also he can try to make online assignments on different platforms as Wizer, Kahoot",113,interactivity
bye,113,generic
bye,113,generic
can we continue or the time is over?,113,generic
depends on the condition the students have but have great chances to encorange exploration. The material for examples also the previous knowledge of the students are facts that must be considered,113,learning
different types of video may help,113,generic

I Â´n this case they can implement hybrid class and sugest this idea to Ms Wels,113,generic
i agree,113,generic
i also think that the case of Ms Heikenen can be a generation problem and maybe after knowing the benefits of tools and technology in the class can help with this issue too,113,technology
i am fine,113,generic
I am so sorry for being late,113,generic
i do not know too,113,generic
i mean when their are positive like if the student had a positive answer or behavior,113,generic

Mr. Heineken may try to encourage students to create their own portfolio blog,113,generic
"Mr. Heineken thinks it's shocking that today's youth spend so much of their time on their smartphones and other devices. In his opinion, social media leads to young people reading less and a lack of engagement with intellectually challenging content. He is also convinced that young people are becoming lonely and no longer socialize with their peers. Therefore, he can't understand why other colleagues want to incorporate digital content into their learning programs. Ms. Wells, on the other hand, is convinced that one could completely eliminate face-to-face classes and just replace them with digital learning opportunities. She has already opened a Facebook group for her students to ask questions, which works very well.â€‹  Discuss to what extent you agree or disagree with Mr. Heineken and Ms. Wells.â€‹ How can Mr. Heineken and Ms. Wells effectively implement digital learning opportunities?",113,interactivity

Do you both agree with the following statement: Descriptive feedback contains specific information. Why?,113,transmission
yes i think the feedback must be with words to keep the students trying,113,transmission

"Mr. Heineken thinks it's shocking that today's youth spend so much of their time on their smartphones and other devices.

He is also convinced that young people are becoming lonely and no longer socialize with their peers. Therefore, he can't understand why other colleagues want to incorporate digital content into their learning programs. Ms. Wells, on the other hand, is convinced that one could completely eliminate face-to-face classes and just replace them with digital learning opportunities. She has already opened a Facebook group for her students to ask questions, which works very well.â€‹  Discuss to what extent you agree or disagree with Mr. Heineken and Ms. Wells.â€‹ How can Mr. Heineken and Ms. Wells effectively implement digital learning opportunities?",113,interactivity

"well, I partly agree with Ms Wells) it is already happening. step by step but especially during pandemic we taught online",113,generic
yes! agree,113,generic
also could be flipped class as well,113,interactivity
also we could expose positive experience to use social media to conect and present topics and discusions for Ms Heineken classes,113,interactivity

yes like social media and tools. like duoligo that was presented in rhe video,113,interactivity
different types of video may help,113,generic
Mr. Heineken may try to encourage students to create their own portfolio blog,113,generic

Education requires that teachers understand the learnersâ€™ interests to facilitate the learning process. Effective orchestration of approaches is required in a classroom. BYOD (bring your own device) approach is perfect for implementing smartphones as learning tools. So I would say, Mr. Heineken should see this situation as positive and make use of it in the learning process. There are variants of hybrid learning like flipped classroom. The benefits are that it is an individually controlled learning process, students can watch videos anytime they want and repeat. But you never know if students really do all those things. By making the lessons fully online might not be fitting for every student. I also like online education better.

Ms. Wells can encourage students to have professional online profiles, share up-to-date and learning related posts online. She can encourage the students to create their own learning portfolios.

Exactly. :),111,generic
"For example, Ms. Brown can make use of audience response systems, where the question appears on the screens and after ss. answer the question, answers are presented together and can be discussed immediately. OR; Ms. Brown can make use of individual awareness tools, which could be then analyzed in a computer. ALSO; Ms. Brown can make use of e-portfolios, which are a collection of personal achievements, also called digital learning diaries. Learners collect samples of their work online.",111,transmission

"Good, tired this week. :)",111,generic
"Great. :) I think that we basically go in the same direrction. I mean he can build up really good feedback tool, but the drawback of my idea is that maybe all these kind of feedback implementaions together can be overwhelming, so it needs to be thought carefully how we can take the best from each of them.",111,transmission

"Hey, I was as well writing in paralel. So that is how I see it, what do you think?",111,generic
Hi,111,generic
Hi Jane. :D Orchestration is combination of approaches and social forms of learning. It is important how a teacher orchestrates different kinds of learning arrangements with activities.,111,learning
"hi mami, all good?",111,generic
"Hi, I am here! :) How are you today? :)",111,generic
"Hi, I stayed here as well, just in a case",111,generic

How about supporting the learning community of students? What are your thought on that?,111,generic
How are you doing?,111,generic
I agree,111,generic
"I agree with it, as my peer already mention, due to its informational value. However I think that feedback is more than that.",111,generic
"I agree with you, yes.",111,generic
I agree with you.,111,generic
"I agree, that is great!",111,generic
I agree.,111,generic

I believe we did a good job. It was nice discussing the case with you. :),111,generic
"I couldn't finish, I will after we answer Jane if that is ok with you? :D",111,generic
I dislike Jane :D,111,generic
"I do agree partially with the statement. Descriptive feedback is directed to the specific learner, its current place and how he/she/them should proceed further from the current state to seek improvement. From that point of view it contains specific infromation, however, they are not predetermined before giving it to specific learners.",111,transmission
"I do not know, maybe we should proceed with the assignment. :) Yeah, we do well this together. :)",111,generic
I dont see her question,111,generic
"I find badges to be very interesting because I am a gamer myself so I love collecting those on Steam. Something like this being implemented in education is really amazing. Badges indicate the skills of the students, and they can be part of their e-portfolios for example. So, in general, badges symbolize personal achievements.",111,learning
I guess not,111,generic
I had fun (besides Jane),111,generic
I had fun! (besides Jane),111,generic
I have answered shortly,111,generic
I just exited chat accidentally,111,generic
"I just saw that there are a lot of people in the chatroom, I am not sure if they are directly in ours",111,generic
I look forward to the end of the semester :D,111,generic

I must leave now. :),111,generic
I really apologize for making you wait as I didn't know about the situation...,111,generic
I remember from Moodle that on last two weeks there was going to be push questions like such (from Jane Doe),111,generic
"I think also not only correct answers should be shown in case a student gave a wrong answer, but also a description of why the answer was wrong or why the correct answer is indeed correct.",111,generic
"I think Jane won't be asking questions anymore, the time is up.",111,generic
I think that she should have professional profile and that facebook group can even function as a learning communitiy,111,learning
I think that should be probably the last question by her,111,generic
I think that students should have a certain task that would include collaboration.,111,interactivity
I think that too. :),111,generic
I think thi is is it from chat discussions,111,interactivity
"I think yes, but not sure",111,generic
"I thought so, too. I don't think we can specify badges and e-portfolios as tools.",111,learning
I thought that I was partnered with someone else and,111,generic
I wait a bit for you.,111,generic
I was rushing. :D,111,generic
I will copy and paste here.,111,generic
I would say I mostly disagree with Mr. Heineken. I think he lacks the understanding regarding the interests of the new generation. And I am undecided regarding Ms. Wells. Her approach depends on the circumstances and student age too.,111,generic
I write mine,111,generic
If we will be together for me both is fine. Which time would be fitting for you?,111,generic
implement it alongside his pedagogical practice.,111,generic
"In many ways, people would agree to it. However I would not, as technology goes beyond it can represent the supportive educational or life gadget. If thinks about e-portfolios and badges, those are more features than tools.",111,learning
"In my opinion, Ms. Brown combines feedback with technology, which is good. BUT the app provides students with only EVALUATIVE feedback by showing if the answer was correct or incorrect. As I said before, the key feature of feedback is its informational value. Feedback should be descriptive rather than evaluative because evaluative feedback has less beneficial effects. (So, Ms. Allen is right but not fully)",111,transmission
"In my perspective, as the time changes the methods should be adapted accordingly. Nowadays, the students are born and raised with technology so they are digital natives. Summarizing the slides is uninteresting and suggests that there is only text and no audio-visual materials on the slides. Information is only transferred via a linear fashion. There is need for diagrammatic representation of the learning material. Diagrams are generally easier to understand and when given together with text, it is much more effective and multi-sensory.",111,learning

It is fine. We can do the peer discussion now.,111,interactivity
It is going to be a bit repetitive here because I believe I have mentioned the importance of group work already.

"Ok, so we have a Mr. Brown who wants to design basically behaviouristic based feedback tool and Ms Allen who is not agreeing.",111,transmission
"Ok, then I start writing my answer for the first question of the assignment.",111,generic
"Ok, then we can move to the next one. The 2. question is:	How could Prof. Smith make the best use of multimedia in his learning materials and how could he support a learning community of his students?",111,media
"on 1-5:3 :), basically neither disagree nor agree",111,generic
on nd question,111,generic
otherwise we won't discuss the main case,111,generic
Please go ahead first and I will be typing alongside. :),111,generic
practical*,111,generic
Prof. should combine the pedagogical practice and multimedia use in the class. He should make sure that the students are involved and there is a meanin,111,media
"Prof. should combine the pedagogical practice and multimedia use in the class. He should make sure that the students are involved and there is a meaningful information flow between students. A new learning arrangement here is necessary. Teacher centered approach should be replaced with everyone being involved in the process accordingly. Thus, supporting the learning community of the students as well.",111,media
"prof. smith is summarizing slides by bullet points and doesn't want to change his method because it has worked so far. Ms. Doe says that the flashier the presentation, the better.",111,media
"Questions are great ways to learn more, understand the topic clearer. It is very useful both ways when teacher asks a question or when students ask a question. Thanks to questions, both parties are more involved in the process. It is easier to detect what has not been understood or what has been interesting enough to be questioned etc.",111,interactivity

See you next week at 10 again.,111,generic
See you then. :),111,generic
See you! :),111,generic
"See you. :) And yeah, me too. No worries, i though it can happen because of the time zones. :)",111,generic
she didnt pop up for me,111,generic
She has another question do you see it?,111,generic
she posted another one,111,generic
should we continue,111,generic
SHould we sum up somehow the first question then and move further to the next one?,111,generic
"So after, educating, he could see what are appropriate methods and technics and multimedia princeples for his presentations of the concept.",111,generic
"So basically, for our discussion, I do agree with you and I think that basically we have similar view on it. maybe we can for the sake of time, we can proceed to the second question as that shoudl explain how we can include technology in it.",111,generic
"So basically, I do not agree. It refers to quantitative measurement more and includes value of judgement more than the actual qualitative traits of the feedback.",111,transmission
"So basically, I would say, that digital learning environment can  be implemented by using some standard LMS or similar platforms where students could find video for learning, find the websites or material that are OER and so on... Regrading digital environment, I would say that flipped classroom can be beneficial for the students and teachers as students would benefit from sharing their thought on online presence lectures. However mobile learning, good for small chunks of infromation can be implemented as well so Mr. Heineken can combine discussions with micro-learning approach",111,interactivity
"SO basically, regarding the first question, I agree and disagree with both of them, but more disagree than agree. I think that approach of Mr. Brown enhances the bihevioristic incorrent/correct answer and has not infromative value. It can be good just for the overview of what student has done good and what not, but beyond that, this digital feedback has no value. On the other hand, Mr. Allen talks about giving kind of descriptive feedback through regular talk, which can be beneficial for the learner, but coducted in a such way it is time -consuming and not economic at all. Students can ask the questions directly, however, this type of feedback, can better implemented in digital envronment.",111,transmission
So do you agree with Mr. Heineken and/or Ms. Wells?,111,generic
"So I belive that Prof. Smith definitely need a change regarding his method. I don't agree with his approach to teaching. On the other hand, Ms. Doe is not completely right in what she is saying. Implementing multimedia in a learning process should be thought carefully and done successfully, not in a mindless way for the sake of it.",111,media
"So Jane.... I agree, question usually promote deeper underestanding and can enhance user to approach the solution from multi perspectivenes. Questions can lead to integration, understanding, confilict as well, but usually this shows deeper undertsanding on the subject matter.",111,transmission
"So my last sentence was on assignment, now I will answer Jane. :D",111,generic
So see you then next week at 10 am Berlin time and no worries. :),111,generic
so that they can function as a learning community,111,learning
so you can answer now,111,generic
"So, basically, Mr, Smith should combine text, audio and visual accordingly to present the elarning material",111,generic
"So, first education of the teacher for approrpiate pedagogical approach, then combining the text, audio and visual material accordingly. During the class, it should be learner - centered, which would include the crticial thing, discussion that enhance the problem solving and co-construction of the knowledge, where students are able to learn as well from their mistakes. And I agree with you, this would be my suggestion for his change. Which also differes from the Ms. Doe's suggetsion ""the more, the merrier"", but includes more insightful approach.",111,interactivity
"So, I think that technology feedback should be implemented and additionall to correct/incorrect answers, the feedback should contain the correct answers. Additionally, I think that teacher can make this tools applicable in classroom environment through different ways. There is ARS, where he can ask the question of students in class and then show the answers which would promote attention to the content and possible discussion. Badging systems can be implemented as well,, as the students can be rewarded for the good work or finishing first or so on. They can maybe have some backchannel, that does need to function as on online conferences, but to be teh place where students can ask questions in general on leacture. The teacher can have dashoboard and have view on the students perfromance and other important emans. I think awareness tools and and questionairess ate good as well place for e-portfolios where student can write down what they think.",111,transmission

"â€¢	Discuss to what extent you agree or disagree with Prof. Smith and Ms. Doe.",111,generic
this is the first question.,111,generic
"alright, then let me summarize the main points before we dive in.",111,generic
Sure.,111,generic
"prof. smith is summarizing slides by bullet points and doesn't want to change his method because it has worked so far. Ms. Doe says that the flashier the presentation, the better.",111,generic
would you like to start with your own opinion first or shall I give it a go? :),111,#N/A
"Yes. From my perspective, Mr. Smith can improve his lessons, by instead of summarizing the discussions in bullet points, he can make the summaries and main concepts available according to the multimedia principles. o	However, the multimedia principles need to be applied accordingly. E.g. if we want to explain how the complex mechanism of some machine works, spatial contiguity principle probably would be more appropriate. The teacher needs to know to access which information is better to be represented by text and which as pictorial information and how the two main sensory channel should be occupied.",111,media
"Hey, I was as well writing in paralel. So that is how I see it, what do you think?",111,generic
"As well, I think that he can give a task to the students that would include the group work, as they already self-organized.",111,interactivity
so that they can function as a learning community,111,learning
"In my perspective, as the time changes the methods should be adapted accordingly. Nowadays, the students are born and raised with technology so they are digital natives. Summarizing the slides is uninteresting and suggests that there is only text and no audio-visual materials on the slides. Information is only transferred via a linear fashion. There is need for diagrammatic representation of the learning material. Diagrams are generally easier to understand and when given together with text, it is much more effective and multi-sensory.",111,learning
Does this has any sense for you?,111,generic
"In my perspective, as the time changes the methods should be adapted accordingly. Nowadays, the students are born and raised with technology so they are digital natives. Summarizing the slides is uninteresting and suggests that there is only text and no audio-visual materials on the slides. Information is only transferred via a linear fashion. There is need for diagrammatic representation of the learning material. Diagrams are generally easier to understand and when given together with text, it is much more effective and multi-sensory.",111,learning
"Sorry, i try typing fast enough :D",111,generic
"Yeah, sorry for overlapping. :)",111,generic
I agree with you.,111,generic
"Exactly, group work here is very important. Prof. wants that his students work in groups but this type of small group work is isolated, therefore not effective.",111,interactivity
"Basically, Mr. SMith could combine text, audio and visual material accordingly to explain the main concepts, right?",111,generic
"Yes, I believe so. But this is not enough.",111,generic
Because making use of multimedia mindlessly is not the right answer.,111,media
"So, basically, Mr, Smith should combine text, audio and visual accordingly to present the elarning material",111,generic
I agree,111,generic
He must educate himself about it first to use it effectively and combine it with pedagogy.,111,generic
"What do you think,  what should be most appropriate use of multimedia?",111,media
"Here, I think I will disagree with Ms. Doe regarding the use of multimedia that way for example.",111,media
"Ok, so educating himself would be the first step, to see what are the most appropriate methods to conduct in teaching, right?",111,generic
"Because there is no such thing as ""flashier the better"".",111,generic
yes,111,generic
yes,111,generic
"Yes, I agree, not just implement everything.",111,generic
"So after, educating, he could see what are appropriate methods and technics and multimedia princeples for his presentations of the concept.",111,media
"It might even be distracting if the slides are too flashy. Let's say he implemented multimedia in the slides, but everything is teacher-centered, then it is also problematic, it does not facilitate learning that way.",111,media
"I agree with you, yes.",111,generic
"The principles should allow student to discuss and co-consztruct the knowledge in class, do you agree with it?",111,generic
"Of course. Students should work together, be involved. Critical thinking should be promoted, as well as common problem solving.",111,interactivity
SHould we sum up somehow the first question then and move further to the next one?,111,generic
"And if there are mistakes along the process, they should be treated as means for improvement.",111,generic
Yes. We may sum up.,111,generic
I agree.,111,generic
"So I belive that Prof. Smith definitely need a change regarding his method. I don't agree with his approach to teaching. On the other hand, Ms. Doe is not completely right in what she is saying. Implementing multimedia in a learning process should be thought carefully and done successfully, not in a mindless way for the sake of it.",111,media
What is your summary to the first question?,111,generic
"So, first education of the teacher for approrpiate pedagogical approach, then combining the text, audio and visual material accordingly. During the class, it should be learner - centered, which would include the crticial thing, discussion that enhance the problem solving and co-construction of the knowledge, where students are able to learn as well from their mistakes. And I agree with you, this would be my suggestion for his change. Which also differes from the Ms. Doe's suggetsion ""the more, the merrier"", but includes more insightful approach.",111,interactivity
Exactly. :),111,generic
Then now we can discuss the second question.,111,generic
"Ok, then we can move to the next one. The 2. question is:	How could Prof. Smith make the best use of multimedia in his learning materials and how could he support a learning community of his students?",111,media
It is going to be a bit repetitive here because I believe I have mentioned the importance of group work already. Students should work together and be involved in the process alongside the teacher and share their knowledge with each other. The teacher should create the right environment for this.,111,interactivity
It is going to be a bit repetitive here because I believe I have mentioned the importance of group work already. Students should work together and be involved in the process alongside the teacher and share their knowledge with each other. The teacher should create the right environment for this.,111,interactivity
A new learning arrangement,111,learning
"There was a mention of jigsaw technique in the course videos, for example. I think it is a great way of implementing the new learning environment.",111,learning
"I agree. So for example, regarding multimedia principles, he can use spatial contiguity principle and make the text explaining picture or a diagram close one to another and so on.",111,media
What are your thoughts?,111,generic
"Yes, JigSaw is a good idea I think.",111,generic
I think that students should have a certain task that would include collaboration.,111,generic
How about supporting the learning community of students? What are your thought on that?,111,learning
Sorry. :) I think that students should have a certain task that would include collaboration.,111,interactivity
"The chat function is a bit overlapping sometimes, no worries. :D",111,generic
Then I believe we can also sum up the second question. :),111,generic
"They can be novices about the topic and should reserach more to solve the task, than share between each other what they found so the move further to become experts in the community.",111,generic
Does that sound ok?,111,generic
"Yes, they should be more involved and then share their knowledge with each other to gradually improve themselves on the subject area.",111,generic
"Then, in summary, the Prof. should educate himself regarding the multimedia use in learning materials and learning arrangements. After that, he should",111,media
implement it alongside his pedagogical practice.,111,generic
"Yes, and students can participate in peer-to-peer learning, as this kind of a learning community, right?",111,learning
"As for supporting the learning community, he should make sure that the students are involved in the process then a simple teacher-centered learning env",111,learning
environment.,111,generic
The chat is bad. :D,111,generic
"Yes, i agree to that. :)",111,generic
Alright then... :),111,generic
I believe we did a good job. It was nice discussing the case with you. :),111,generic
"Students can also share with their peers what they have came up to in smaller groups and then discuss on the subject area, maybe?",111,generic
"Oh sorry, I didn't see that. Yes, information flow is also an important part in this.",111,generic
"Students can than prepare the oresentations of their small group findings and discuss it with the peers in the whole class, amybe?",111,generic
"And, as well, it was nice talking to you. :)",111,generic
The chat is late.:),111,generic
"Yes, those are interesting suggestions. :)",111,generic
"Ok so, sum up maybe the second question? :)",111,generic
Please go ahead first and I will be typing alongside. :),111,generic
Me too. I am typing. :),111,generic
Prof. should combine the pedagogical practice and multimedia use in the class. He should make sure that the students are involved and there is a meanin,111,media
"Prof. should combine the pedagogical practice and multimedia use in the class. He should make sure that the students are involved and there is a meaningful information flow between students. A new learning arrangement here is necessary. Teacher centered approach should be replaced with everyone being involved in the process accordingly. Thus, supporting the learning community of the students as well.",111,media
That is my summary in general.,111,generic
"Educators educate himself on learning arangements and pedagogical approaches and makes sure that students are involved in the class. Jigsaw can be one of the techniques implemented, where students work first on smaller groups and thatn share the knowledge with whole class adn become experts on the subject area. In such a way, he would also support the learning community of students. :)",111,learning
"I agree, that is great!",111,generic
Mulrimedia Principles should be applied accordingly.,111,media
"Ok nice, then we have everything. :)",111,generic
We meet at 10am next time. I apologize for the inconvenience again. :),111,generic
So see you then next week at 10 am Berlin time and no worries. :),111,generic
Glad that I stayed and we did it.:),111,generic
See you! :),111,generic
"Yes, i was scared that i am left out :D",111,generic
Thanks for waiting. :),111,generic
"See you. :) And yeah, me too. No worries, i though it can happen because of the time zones. :)",111,generic
See you next time. :),111,generic
Have a nice day. :),111,generic
You too!,111,generic
"Thanks, bye.:)",111,generic
"Hi, I am here! :) How are you today? :)",111,generic
"Hello! We start in 3 minutes, just wanted to let you know that I am here on time. :D",111,generic
"I am fine, how about you?",111,generic
"Good, tired this week. :)",111,generic
"Let's start, shall we?",111,generic
"Ah sorry, just saw that you said in 3 min. :)",111,generic
We can start now,111,generic
"I just saw that there are a lot of people in the chatroom, I am not sure if they are directly in ours",111,generic
I guess not,111,generic
"God, this chat room is terrible in general. :D Anyways",111,generic
Let's go!,111,generic
Lets go,111,generic
"No, I think that we have assigned partners. I have asked once and been told that only two people can be in the same shatroom, so maybe they in some separate rooms. :)",111,generic
Alright then :),111,generic
Let's start,111,generic
"Ok, so we have a Mr. Brown who wants to design basically behaviouristic based feedback tool and Ms Allen who is not agreeing.",111,transmission
Do you both agree with the following statement: Feedback refers to transmission of information about learner performance. Why?,111,transmission
"The key feature of feedback is its informational value. Effective feedback is clear, specific, and concrete. It is informative about success criteria. So, yes I agree with the statement.",111,transmission
Are you also writing?,111,generic
I wait a bit for you.,111,generic
"I agree with it, as my peer already mention, due to its informational value. However I think that feedback is more than that.",111,generic
Sorry,111,generic
For waiting for me,111,generic
"No problem, I cannot see when you are typing, that is why. :)",111,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Descriptive feedback contains specific information. Why?,111,generic
"Descriptive feedback, as the name suggests, is informative. It describes what students have done during the process and suggests improvements accordingly.",111,transmission
"I do agree partially with the statement. Descriptive feedback is directed to the specific learner, its current place and how he/she/them should proceed further from the current state to seek improvement. From that point of view it contains specific infromation, however, they are not predetermined before giving it to specific learners.",111,transmission
"Not every feedback is the same, it is specified according to a learner. In that manner, it is specific.",111,transmission
"It contains learning goals and success criteria, which is also specific.",111,learning
"Yes, I agree with that.",111,generic
Will we always wait for questions to answer this time?,111,generic
"Exactly, it is lead by the type of information which can be part of the feedback (learner objective, how to improve, etc), but it is learner-specific.",111,transmission
"Yes, you said what I meant to say. :)",111,generic
"I do not know, maybe we should proceed with the assignment. :) Yeah, we do well this together. :)",111,generic
"Ok, then I start writing my answer for the first question of the assignment.",111,generic
"In my opinion, Ms. Brown combines feedback with technology, which is good. BUT the app provides students with only EVALUATIVE feedback by showing if the answer was correct or incorrect. As I said before, the key feature of feedback is its informational value. Feedback should be descriptive rather than evaluative because evaluative feedback has less beneficial effects. (So, Ms. Allen is right but not fully)",111,transmission
"I think also not only correct answers should be shown in case a student gave a wrong answer, but also a description of why the answer was wrong or why the correct answer is indeed correct.",111,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Evaluative feedback refers to measure of quality. Why?,111,transmission
"Jane, you pop up in the middle of my argument. :D",111,generic
Let's keep up with Jane. :D,111,generic
"SO basically, regarding the first question, I agree and disagree with both of them, but more disagree than agree. I think that approach of Mr. Brown enhances the bihevioristic incorrent/correct answer and has not infromative value. It can be good just for the overview of what student has done good and what not, but beyond that, this digital feedback has no value. On the other hand, Mr. Allen talks about giving kind of descriptive feedback through regular talk, which can be beneficial for the learner, but coducted in a such way it is time -consuming and not economic at all. Students can ask the questions directly, however, this type of feedback, can better implemented in digital envronment.",111,transmission
"So my last sentence was on assignment, now I will answer Jane. :D",111,generic
"I couldn't finish, I will after we answer Jane if that is ok with you? :D",111,generic
Yeah. :D,111,generic
"So basically, I do not agree. It refers to quantitative measurement more and includes value of judgement more than the actual qualitative traits of the feedback.",111,transmission
"An example for evaluative feedback is school grades, which show if your score was good or bad. So, it is rather referring to quantity measuring. One grade cannot determine if students' overall performance was qualitative or not. So, I don't agree with this statement.",111,transmission
Two people one mind. :D,111,generic
"Hehe, I like being partnered with you. :D",111,generic
"Yeah, me to with you. :)",111,generic
"So, should we go back to assignment and just answer to Jane when the question pops up?",111,generic
Do we now wait for Jane?,111,generic
:DDD,111,generic
"Do you both agree with the following statement: Questions lead to integration, understanding. Why?",111,learning
Jane likes to get in between my arguments so,111,generic
SEE,111,generic
Hahahha,111,generic
"Questions are great ways to learn more, understand the topic clearer. It is very useful both ways when teacher asks a question or when students ask a question. Thanks to questions, both parties are more involved in the process. It is easier to detect what has not been understood or what has been interesting enough to be questioned etc.",111,learning
"So Jane.... I agree, question usually promote deeper underestanding and can enhance user to approach the solution from multi perspectivenes. Questions can lead to integration, understanding, confilict as well, but usually this shows deeper undertsanding on the subject matter.",111,learning
sorry for typos,111,generic
I remember from Moodle that on last two weeks there was going to be push questions like such (from Jane Doe),111,generic
That means we will always answer hers I think?,111,generic
"So basically, for our discussion, I do agree with you and I think that basically we have similar view on it. maybe we can for the sake of time, we can proceed to the second question as that shoudl explain how we can include technology in it.",111,interactivity
"Yeah, I remeber it too. :)",111,generic
Yes let's do that,111,generic
We should answer to her question when it pops. :),111,generic
otherwise we won't discuss the main case,111,generic
"Yeah, let's continue. :)",111,generic
I write mine,111,generic
Yeah. :),111,generic
me too,111,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Technology refers to tools. Why?,111,technology
:D,111,generic
:d,111,generic
:D,111,generic
Do you mean awareness tools for example? The data is collected and visualized with the ability of technology and evaluation of data is done in a short time. There are also badges and e-portfolios.,111,technology
"In many ways, people would agree to it. However I would not, as technology goes beyond it can represent the supportive educational or life gadget. If thinks about e-portfolios and badges, those are more features than tools.",111,technology
"I thought so, too. I don't think we can specify badges and e-portfolios as tools.",111,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: Badges display accomplishments. Why?,111,learning
"I find badges to be very interesting because I am a gamer myself so I love collecting those on Steam. Something like this being implemented in education is really amazing. Badges indicate the skills of the students, and they can be part of their e-portfolios for example. So, in general, badges symbolize personal achievements.",111,learning
"Yes, tbadges as means from video games, imeplemente as gamefication features, are usually means of feedback, where certain level of badge indicates how well someone is doing and what they accomplished and indicates the level of it. However, badge can be also indication of membership for example, so there are different purposes of it.",111,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: E-portfolios display accomplishments. Why?,111,learning
"Badges can be collected for life also outside of school. Yes, they also have the meaning of being part of somewhere like sports club etc.",111,generic
"E-portfolios are collection of personal achievements of a learner. They collect samples their own samples online. There, also learning processes are documented.",111,learning
They collect samples of their own work online*,111,generic
I was rushing. :D,111,generic
"E-portfolios are also means that display achievements, but they are plavce where student can see more detials on its abilities, skills and the good thing, they are personal achievement overview documments, expandable overtime where students can track their own achievements and processes.",111,learning
"I think Jane won't be asking questions anymore, the time is up.",111,generic
"Yeah. As soon we will be finishing, maybe quick overview on the second question. One senetnce maybe or one view on it?",111,generic
"Yes, I already wrote my answer to that.",111,generic
I will copy and paste here.,111,generic
Cool,111,generic
I am also writing now,111,generic
"For example, Ms. Brown can make use of audience response systems, where the question appears on the screens and after ss. answer the question, answers are presented together and can be discussed immediately. OR; Ms. Brown can make use of individual awareness tools, which could be then analyzed in a computer. ALSO; Ms. Brown can make use of e-portfolios, which are a collection of personal achievements, also called digital learning diaries. Learners collect samples of their work online.",111,learning
ss. (students),111,generic
"So, I think that technology feedback should be implemented and additionall to correct/incorrect answers, the feedback should contain the correct answers. Additionally, I think that teacher can make this tools applicable in classroom environment through different ways. There is ARS, where he can ask the question of students in class and then show the answers which would promote attention to the content and possible discussion. Badging systems can be implemented as well,, as the students can be rewarded for the good work or finishing first or so on. They can maybe have some backchannel, that does need to function as on online conferences, but to be teh place where students can ask questions in general on leacture. The teacher can have dashoboard and have view on the students perfromance and other important emans. I think awareness tools and and questionairess ate good as well place for e-portfolios where student can write down what they think.",111,transmission
Awesome! Your point gave me extra ideas now as well.,111,generic
"Great. :) I think that we basically go in the same direrction. I mean he can build up really good feedback tool, but the drawback of my idea is that maybe all these kind of feedback implementaions together can be overwhelming, so it needs to be thought carefully how we can take the best from each of them.",111,transmission
"Exactly, too much feedback does not mean it is good. Things should be planned beforehand.",111,transmission
"Then, I think we covered everything.",111,generic
We will meet again next week. :),111,generic
I think that too. :),111,generic
See you then. :),111,generic
See you next week at 10 again.,111,generic
Have a nice week! :),111,generic
"Yeah, bye, have a nice day. :)",111,generic
And week too. :),111,generic
Hello!,111,generic
I am here :),111,generic
Hi,111,generic
How are you doing?,111,generic
"I am good, a bit tired, you?",111,generic
Same.,111,generic
"Work, school, exams approaching..",111,generic
"Ah, believe you... Shall we start?",111,generic
I look forward to the end of the semester :D,111,generic
Sure,111,generic
Will there be Jane again asking questions?,111,generic
Me too. :),111,generic
"I think yes, but not sure",111,generic
"Alright, we will know if she is there :D",111,generic
"Yeah, true. :)",111,generic
So do you agree with Mr. Heineken and/or Ms. Wells?,111,generic
"on 1-5:3 :), basically neither disagree nor agree",111,generic
Could you explain why? and then I share my part with you :),111,generic
yeah,111,generic
writing :),111,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Orchestration refers to teacher interventions. Why?,111,learning
"there are some points that Mr. Heineken mentions and are true regarding socialization and loneliness, however some people do get on social media to join groups and find e.g. emotional support. Ms Allen, has actually a good perspective and with her I could maybe fully agree, regarding online classes and Facebook group, as I am taking classes mostly online during covid, so it is fine",111,generic
"@jJane, so basically yes, but this is partially true. Orchestration includes learning arangements, planning, distibution og the roles end so on....",111,learning
Hi Jane. :D Orchestration is combination of approaches and social forms of learning. It is important how a teacher orchestrates different kinds of learning arrangements with activities.,111,learning
"@mami Today technology is so advanced that we can identify our smartphones as multipurpose tools. Smartphones are part of our lives, why shouldnâ€™t they be part of our lives at school too? Education requires that teachers understand the learnersâ€™ interests to facilitate the learning process. Effective orchestration of approaches is required in a classroom. BYOD (bring your own device) approach is perfect for implementing smartphones as learning tools. So I would say, Mr. Heineken should see this situation as positive and make use of it in the learning process. There are variants of hybrid learning like flipped classroom. The benefits are that it is an individually controlled learning process, students can watch videos anytime they want and repeat. But you never know if students really do all those things. By making the lessons fully online might not be fitting for every student. I also like online education better. If there would be online lesson time in addition to Facebook and videos where students and the teacher can discuss the learning subject and do activities then it would be great.",111,interactivity
"@hasc, to continue... but I personally would prefer some hybrid apporaches or a flipped classroom. as well I think using social media is good, but the problem can emerge if they have problems with internet or are minors and their parent do not agree for them to be online due to privacy",111,media
Yes that is a good point regarding student age,111,generic
That is so awkward with waiting a question from Jane :d,111,generic
"Yeah actually you are right, I thought to say that he has some points which are more general about social media impact, but using mobile learning and of course impolementing learning digitally should not be disregarded and in those terms I do not agree with Mr. Heineken",111,interactivity
"yeah, I know :)",111,interactivity
"Do you both agree with the following statement: Hybrid learning includes rotation model, flex model. Why?",111,interactivity
"I mean, I myself use a lot of mobile learning due to its conveniancy",111,interactivity
I would say I mostly disagree with Mr. Heineken. I think he lacks the understanding regarding the interests of the new generation. And I am undecided regarding Ms. Wells. Her approach depends on the circumstances and student age too.,111,generic
Let's discuss the second question as well from the case study until Jane pops up,111,generic
"Yeah, actually you are right, I basically more disagree with him and with her kind of a agree, with points to be taken into account",111,generic
now back to jane,111,generic
jane popped,111,generic
:D,111,generic
I dont see her question,111,generic
she didnt pop up for me,111,generic
"there are some points that Mr. Heineken mentions and are true regarding socialization and loneliness, however some people do get oonsocial me",111,interactivity
sorry,111,generic
not that,111,generic
"Do you both agree with the following statement: Hybrid learning includes rotation model, flex model. Why?",111,interactivity
Do you both agree with the following statement: Mobile learning refers to learning with mobile devices. Why?,111,interactivity
"Those are variants of hybrid learning, yes. There is also flipped classroom. @jane",111,interactivity
"@jane so yes, regarding hybrid learniing.",111,learning
"Those are variants of hybrid learning, yes. There is also flipped classroom. @jane",111,interactivity
She has another question do you see it?,111,generic
she posted another one,111,generic
another question,111,generic
do you see it?,111,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Mobile learning refers to learning with mobile devices. Why?,111,interactivity
"Regradinng mobile learning, it can be a tablet or similar device that is convinient for mobility and-on  to-go situations.",111,learning
"yeah, I saw it.:)",111,generic
today is such confusion,111,generic
:),111,generic
"Yes, mobile learning refers to the use of digital tools within student experience.",111,interactivity
exactly,111,generic
I dislike Jane :D,111,generic
hahaha,111,generic
Before she pops again lets write our answers for the second question too,111,generic
"me to, a bit disrupts the discussion",111,generic
yeah,111,generic
lwet's do it,111,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Mobile devices are needed for mobile learning. Why?,111,interactivity
"They are used for data collection, so yes they are needed.",111,generic
hello,111,generic
"They are used as ""means to an end"" in partical experience.",111,generic
practical*,111,generic
"hi mami, all good?",111,generic
sorry,111,generic
I just exited chat accidentally,111,generic
as everything dissapeared,111,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Mobile devices are needed for mobile learning. Why?,111,interactivity
Jane posted this,111,generic
but yeas they are needed for mobile learning,111,interactivity
sorry,111,generic
so you can answer now,111,generic
god,111,generic
:D,111,generic
I have answered shortly,111,generic
up,111,generic
should we continue,111,generic

sorry,111,generic
Yes here is my answer,111,generic
"As mentioned before, BYOD approach can be taken into account. But digital tools shouldnâ€™t be in the way of the experience, they should only serve as means to an end. Mr. Heineken can make use of micro-learning opportunities, give ss. tasks on apps on their phone to encourage them to learn on their own and control their own learning process. Ms. Wells can encourage students to have professional online profiles, share up-to-date and learning related posts online. She can encourage the students to create their own learning portfolios. She can then use Facebook group as support for learning. Both approaches can also be combined with other learner arrangements e.g. guiding questions, learning diaries so that student participation is encouraged.",111,learning
ss. refers to students :D,111,generic
"So basically, I would say, that digital learning environment can  be implemented by using some standard LMS or similar platforms where students could find video for learning, find the websites or material that are OER and so on... Regrading digital environment, I would say that flipped classroom can be beneficial for the students and teachers as students would benefit from sharing their thought on online presence lectures. However mobile learning, good for small chunks of infromation can be implemented as well so Mr. Heineken can combine discussions with micro-learning approach",111,interactivity
regarding Ms Wells,111,generic
I think that she should have professional profile and that facebook group can even function as a learning communitiy,111,learning
it good platform to post something and also engage in discussion I would say,111,generic
But basically I agree to what you said and add up a bit,111,generic
Yes we have similar opinions :),111,generic
"Yes, sorry for me being a bit confused",111,generic
"Then I belive we are done, I don't have anything more to add right now. Jane is not posting anything anymore either. :D I must leave today exactly on time. :)",111,generic
Do you have anything else to add?,111,generic
I am tired so it affects :),111,generic
Sure then we are done,111,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Open educational resources are freely accessible resources. Why?,111,learning
OH COME ON JANE,111,generic
yes OER are freely accessible,111,generic
"OER refers to learning materials being shared openly online, free of charge. SO YES.",111,learning
Jane you should watch the videos I think :D,111,generic
"those are online resources, free of charge, easily accessible to peeople online.",111,interactivity
Yes. :),111,generic
I must leave now. :),111,generic

I agree that the aspect he is letting his students to work in groups is great. Many old teachers usually prefer to just present everything on their own.,110,generic
I agree with you,110,generic
"I agree with you. Mr. Heineken is right about students spending less time reading books. Nevertheless, they still engage in intellectual challenging content by listening to audio books and so on.",110,generic
I am against online learning at all because the drop out rate is just too high and the lowest amount of students can actually regulate themselves properly. That's why online university degrees do not have as many students as in-university teaching degrees.,110,learning
I am doing great.,110,generic
"I am getting better, but not fully recovered yet, and you, how are you?",110,generic
I am here :)),110,generic
I am very interested in other participants opinion. I will try to stay available online during the week,110,generic
"I cannot back it up by studies. But I would prefer if students of a young age (pre-school, primary school) should stay in school and be taught only in the classroom because you cannot expect them to regulate their own learning and they are highly depended on the teacher in general. However, when they grow older it makes sense for them to start blended learning and get used to directing their own learning experience more and more. But this should happen gradually and not from today until tomorrow.",110,interactivity
"I do not agree to Mr. Heineken, it is very useful to implement a digital content into learning program.",110,learning
I don't feel very well at the moment (covid 19),110,learning
I don't have any problem to start discussions at 11 AM,110,generic
I guess that's the reason why you were logged in at 10 AM and I started at 11 AM because I thought I am together with another person.,110,generic
I learned quite a lot from our conversations.,110,generic
I 'm agreeing to you,110,generic
I mean 11 AM Central European Time (Germany) from wherever you are attending :D,110,generic
"I mean not everyone can properly understand, tolerate this method (punishment), the main thing is that the punishment is not offensive to the person",110,generic
I share the same opinion,110,generic
"I texted the tutor with all the details of changing my time slot to 11 AM with another person I mentioned the details off. Now we wonder, why they didn't select us in the same group.",110,generic

peer feedback can potentially be a two-way communication process if the student who receives the feedback is further communicating with the other student who provided the feedback.,110,transmission
Peer feedback provides students opportunities to learn from each other,110,transmission
"Personally, I prefer the flipped classroom method. First, students learn instructive lessons online. Afterwards, they meet in the classroom and they work with the teacher on more difficult and demanding tasks.",110,interactivity
Prof. Smith should use this community for his goals,110,generic
"Regarding the case study, I donâ€™t fully agree with both sides. Ms. Brown created an app that only provides evaluative feedback but feedback should be descriptive and informative about success criteria. Descriptive feedback might be time consuming but it doesnâ€™t have to come from a teacher. Peer Feedback can be encouraged, in this way learners would learn from each other. Additionally, feedback and technology can be implemented together. To make this process effective, for example Ms. Brown can make use of badges to give them to students as a symbol of their achievement. Ms. Brown could also use an ARS such as pingo to collect immediate feedback from the students in discuss it later on in the group.",110,media

"Regarding the case study, I donâ€™t fully agree with both sides. Ms. Brown created an app that only provides evaluative feedback but feedback should be descriptive and informative about success criteria. Descriptive feedback might be time consuming but it doesnâ€™t have to come from a teacher. Peer Feedback can be encouraged, in this way learners would learn from each other. Additionally, feedback and technology can be implemented together. To make this process effective, for example Ms. Brown can make use of badges to give them to students as a symbol of their achievement. Ms. Brown could also use an ARS such as pingo to collect immediate feedback from the students in discuss it later on in the group.",110,media
What is your opinion on the case study?,110,generic
"I think, it's good that Ms Brown programmed such app, but I strongy agree that she should add descriptive feedback to that app. It's very important.  Also, if she don't have much time, she should use ARS in the classroom (as you mentioned)",110,transmission
exactly,110,generic
"But I don't agree to Ms Allen, as she thinks that you caanot implement feedback idigitally at all.",110,transmission
I share the same opinion,110,generic
IMO Ms Brown should learn the priciples of providing effective feedback and implement it into her digital feedback app.,110,transmission

an about this case,110,generic
"Today's youth really spend a lot of time on their smartphones and other devices. They perceive the information received in this way very well and can learn from the information received from digital devices. It is true that Young people read less printed books, but they can read in internet and listen to youtube or other videos and learn what they are interested in. young people can socialize with others by social media.",110,interactivity
"I do not agree to Mr. Heineken, it is very useful to implement a digital content into learning program.",110,learning
"I agree with you. Mr. Heineken is right about students spending less time reading books. Nevertheless, they still engage in intellectual challenging content by listening to audio books and so on.",110,generic
same here,110,generic
"I think, we should encourage Using Facebook or other social media in the learning process, for example for asking questions, for giving feedback, or making pols, quizzes, or other activities.",110,transmission
you are right. Mr. Heineken totally neglects the benefits technology can have in enrichening learning experiences. You can use technology and social media in various ways to facilitate learning as you mentioned in your example.,110,learning
Is Mr. Heineken correct in modern learning materials not being challenging enough anymore?,110,learning
*intellectually challenging enough,110,generic
"Why not???? I don't have clear answer to you. but I doubt about Ms. Wells decision completely eliminate face-to-face activities. maybe it would be better, if they use the blended learning, but everything depends on.",110,interactivity
I agree with you,110,generic
let's switch to Ms. Wells opinion,110,generic
"In my opinion, eliminating face-to-face learning is an outrages idea because you cannot leave the regulation of the learning process completly to the students themselves.",110,interactivity
Students will have a much higher drop out rate in courses that they have to regulate the learning themselves because some of them do not have the ability to do so.,110,learning
"Also, they are not prepared well enough to structure their learning times completly by themselves because it was always structured for them so far.",110,learning
what's your opinion on that?,110,generic
"Sorry I was distracted, The doctor came for me, but everything is done now",110,generic
no worries,110,generic
"So, of course I agree to you",110,generic
"In general, I think that, all depends on different circumstances, such as at what level of education the earning program is, what is the field of education, what is the dificulty, what is the need for practical training, and then it should be assessed whether the training is fully digital or online, if blended, and whether to use both online and offline teaching methods",110,interactivity

"In general, I think that, all depends on different circumstances, such as at what level of education the learning is, what is the field of education, what is the dificulty, , what is the need for practical training, and then it should be assessed whether the training is fully digital or online, if mixed, and whether to use both online and offline teaching methods",110,interactivity
you are right. It depends on several factors. There is no yes or no answer.,110,generic
Do you prefer a hybrid learning method?,110,learning
But I prefer the blended learning methods,110,interactivity
is there a special method you have in mind?,110,generic
"the hybrid learning method gives us the opportunities fully use the all posibilities, methods and others",110,learning
"Personally, I prefer the flipped classroom method. First, students learn instructive lessons online. Afterwards, they meet in the classroom and they work with the teacher on more difficult and demanding tasks.",110,interactivity
"Therefore, the teacher doesn't spend time providing the information to students inside the classroom. That's rather something they do at home.",110,interactivity
The teacher takes in the flipped classroom rather the job of a coach instead of a teacher. He/she helps the students to work on projects,110,interactivity
"I absolutely agree to you,",110,generic
do you have experience in using blended learning opportunities as an educator?,110,interactivity
"All the methods mentioned in that videos have many advantages for using in  classroom, but we must carefully choose the doses of using this methods, correct places and etc.",110,interactivity
you are right. It all depends on the specific learning situation.,110,learning
you are right. It depends on the specific learning environment.,110,learning
And what is your opinion about online learning in general?,110,learning
are you experienced in using blended learning methods?,110,interactivity
are you familiar with using blended learning methods?,110,learning
"Of course, although the reason is covid pandemic , but I have such experience, and I think that iWhat is your opinion about online learning in general? If students are younger, we should use blended methods, and as the students ages getting older, we can use more online methods, as they can work independently",110,interactivity
"I cannot back it up by studies. But I would prefer if students of a young age (pre-school, primary school) should stay in school and be taught only in the classroom because you cannot expect them to regulate their own learning and they are highly depended on the teacher in general. However, when they grow older it makes sense for them to start blended learning and get used to directing their own learning experience more and more. But this should happen gradually and not from today until tomorrow.",110,interactivity
I am against online learning at all because the drop out rate is just too high and the lowest amount of students can actually regulate themselves properly. That's why online university degrees do not have as many students as in-university teaching degrees.,110,learning
"I agree about students of young age, you have formulated it all very well.",110,generic
Thanks a lot.,110,generic
Thanks a lot.,110,generic
It was very nice chatting with you mch,110,generic

"Case Study:  Your colleague Ms. Brown programs her own app for automatic student evaluation. This app estimates the students' results directly after they have completed multiple-choice tasks online. The students receive feedback on each task, whether the answer was correct or incorrect. Incorrect answers are only displayed as wrong, but the students are not told what the correct answer would have been. Another colleague, Ms. Allen, doesn't think this is a good approach, because students would learn more if the correct answer would be indicated. She thinks that you cannot implement feedback digitally at all, and that you should rather explain it directly. However, Ms. Brown defends her method. She argues that simply indicating if the answer is correct or incorrect is much faster, which saves time for the students as well as for her as a teacher to be able to explain important things better.â€‹    Discuss to what extent you agree with Ms. Brown's and/or Ms. Allen's reasoning.â€‹   How could Ms. Brown design an effective feedback process with technology?",109,transmission

"i read the case once again and i thought ""presenting slides"" how is used by prof.smith, should not be used when explaining new material.",109,generic
ok,109,generic
"students need time to make their own summarasition firstly. besides,  ""learning from mistakes"" is better",109,learning
"You mean, flipped classroom appraoch?",109,interactivity
yes,109,interactivity
ok,109,generic
I think we can conclude the discussion now.,109,generic
I have nothing to add,109,generic
Do you have somthing more?,109,generic
"me neither, i was thinking about supporting students learning community, but nothing new can be added.",109,learning
Yeah,109,generic
thank you for this discussion,109,generic
Thanks to you as well.,109,generic
See you next week :),109,generic
see you :),109,generic
"Case Study:  Your colleague Ms. Brown programs her own app for automatic student evaluation. This app estimates the students' results directly after they have completed multiple-choice tasks online. The students receive feedback on each task, whether the answer was correct or incorrect. Incorrect answers are only displayed as wrong, but the students are not told what the correct answer would have been. Another colleague, Ms. Allen, doesn't think this is a good approach, because students would learn more if the correct answer would be indicated. She thinks that you cannot implement feedback digitally at all, and that you should rather explain it directly. However, Ms. Brown defends her method. She argues that simply indicating if the answer is correct or incorrect is much faster, which saves time for the students as well as for her as a teacher to be able to explain important things better.â€‹    Discuss to what extent you agree with Ms. Brown's and/or Ms. Allen's reasoning.â€‹   How could Ms. Brown design an effective feedback process with technology?",109,transmission
Hi!,109,transmission
hello,109,generic
How is it going?,109,generic
Seems like we are 4 people today.,109,generic
"good, how about you?",109,generic
I am doing good as well.,109,generic
good to hear that,109,generic
Have you already had a chance to go through the case study for this week?,109,generic
"yes, recently. i guess we can start discussion",109,generic
Ok :),109,generic
I do not agree at all with Ms. Brown's reasoning behind not providing correct answer to MCQ.,109,interactivity
"'Ms. Brown defends her method. She argues that simply indicating if the answer is correct or incorrect is much faster, which saves time for the students as well as for her as a teacher to be able to explain important things better.â€‹'",109,generic
"I think if the answer is incorrect, the app should also provide the correct answer.",109,generic
and give an explanation,109,generic
"i agree with you, aslo  i agree with Ms. Ellen's reasonling",109,generic
"Now with Ms. Allen's reasoning, I agree that correct answer should be indicated, but I don't agree with her about not being able to implement feedback digitally.",109,generic
I think it's possible to do that and it's a good idea.,109,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Feedback refers to transmission of information about learner performance. Why?,109,transmission
"Yes, but I think it is not only limited to that.",109,generic
Feedback could also include information about how to improve the learner performance.,109,transmission
What do you think @Aza?,109,generic
"i agree, but feedback should descrutive. it should be for improvement",109,generic
How could Ms. Brown design an effective feedback process with technology?,109,transmission
as you said before correct answers should be visible for students after test,109,generic
Hmm do you think that should be enough? Or do you agree with Ms. Allen that you cannot implement feedback digitally at all?,109,transmission
"actually this isn't enough. Ms. Brown should use other possible oportunities, like peer feedback, or",109,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Peer feedback refers to two-way communication process. Why?,109,transmission
i agree,109,generic
I do not agree. I don't think peer feedback is always necessarily a two-way communication process.,109,transmission
Peer feedback could also be implemented one way I think,109,transmission
or randomized,109,generic
@Aza peer feedback for multiple choice questions quiz? Interesting idea. How do you think it could be implemented?,109,transmission
"i think peer should ask questions and search answers  for confusing parts of topic, no matter if quiz's answer is completly wrong or not",109,transmission
How would that be different from when the teacher prepares a questionnaire and students search for answers?,109,generic
"for example, using online application whould be great help",109,generic
i think soemtimes students can be involved during preparing a questionnaire,109,generic
"i mean for each other, they will work in peers",109,generic
So are they preparing questionnaire for each other? or work together to prepare questionnaire for other peers?,109,generic
"they work together to prepare questionnaire for other peers, i meant",109,generic
ok. understood :),109,generic
"but first way would be good, too",109,generic
How do you think technology be used to implement this?,109,technology
"when peer prepare questions for each other, and then answering those questions, this can be done by the app",109,generic
"Do you both agree with the following statement: Questions lead to integration, understanding. Why?",109,learning
"Right now, I can only think one advantage of using the app. That it makes the process faster. But I can't see how it is positively affecting the learning process compared to just using regular feedback methods instead of using the app",109,learning
I do not agree. Questions can also lead to conflicts and debates without any consensus.,109,generic
But I think they are helpful in understanding the perspective of another person but it will not necessarily lead to integration of ideas.,109,generic
"questions need to be asked appropriately, but everyone won't think alike. having a different opinion is fine",109,generic
i like your ideas @sash.,109,generic
Ah thanks :D,109,generic
So how could we conclude for today?,109,generic
"face to face comunications during learning process might be more effective, technology just gives use new opportunites and saves us time",109,learning
"I agree, especially regarding peer feedback.",109,transmission
"in cinclusion, Ms. Brown needs to enable students to learn from mistakes",109,generic
Yes.,109,generic
otherwise they won't develop and there will be more mistakes in the near future,109,generic
Her app should be designed in  a way where the feedback is not just correct or incorrect answer but explanation of correct answer.,109,transmission
"If needed, she could also post pre-recorded explanation video of her explaining the correct answer.",109,generic
good point,109,generic
And could make that video interactive video too,109,generic
"oh, right that sounds helpful",109,generic
"I think it's important that feedback should be rather instantaneous. Instead of waiting for the regular classroom to take place (may take several days after the quiz and students may forget or lose interest), the detailed feedback should be provided right after the quiz for maximum effect.",109,generic
This would be my conclusion.,109,generic
that's great conclusion. i can not add anything else,109,generic
Ok. I guess we are done for today's session then.,109,generic
It was a nice discussion with you :),109,generic
"likewise, thank you :)",109,generic
See you next week.,109,generic
Bye!!,109,generic
"see you, bye.",109,generic
Hello,109,generic
hello,109,generic
How are you doing?,109,generic
"not bad, thank you, how about you?",109,generic
I am doing alright as well.,109,generic
Have you got the chance to check the case study for today?,109,generic
i have read the case just the moment ago,109,generic
and you?,109,generic
same,109,generic
"'Mr. Heineken thinks it's shocking that today's youth spend so much of their time on their smartphones and other devices. In his opinion, social media leads to young people reading less and a lack of engagement with intellectually challenging content. He is also convinced that young people are becoming lonely and no longer socialize with their peers. Therefore, he can't understand why other colleagues want to incorporate digital content into their learning programs. '",109,interactivity
Discuss to what extent you agree or disagree with Mr. Heineken,109,generic
I kind of agree Mr. Heineken,109,generic
"I guess, Mr. Heineken is right when he says that today's youth spend so much time on their smartphones",109,generic
Yeah,109,generic
"actually smartphones and other devices are useful, but they have negative effects too",109,generic
Yeah,109,generic
But I disagree with his argument that social media leads to young people reading less and a lack of engagement with intellectually challenging content,109,interactivity
There are social media that actually helps people to read more and interact with intellectually challenging content,109,media
"For example; Youtube tutorials about complex contents, Online learning communities like Stackoverflow",109,learning
and learning communities in Reddit,109,learning
and Facebook,109,generic
"yeah, young people reads more in internet, using social media.",109,media
yeah they all are great help,109,generic
There are pros and cons. I guess it depends on the person who is using social media.,109,interactivity
Maybe incorporating digital contents will help students realize that there is much more to internet than just chatting and sending memes,109,generic
Mr. Heineken might wanted to say 'young people do not read material books',109,generic
Yeah probably,109,generic
"yeah, using social media for good is connected to self-regulation",109,interactivity
Yes. Maybe the aspects of self-regulated learning could be taught to the students first,109,learning
before making them use digital contents for learning,109,learning
So students can better self-regulate their learning,109,learning
i agree with you,109,generic
"What about this: 'Ms. Wells, on the other hand, is convinced that one could completely eliminate face-to-face classes and just replace them with digital learning opportunities. She has already opened a Facebook group for her students to ask questions, which works very well.â€‹'",109,learning
students need to know how to concentrate on learning materials,109,learning
Discuss to what extent you agree or disagree with  Ms. Wells.â€‹,109,generic
i do not agree with Ms. Wells about 'completely eliminate face-to-face-classes',109,interactivity
Do you both agree with the following statement: Orchestration refers to teacher interventions. Why?,109,learning
same. I don't agree with that either.,109,generic
Face-to-face classes are also needed.,109,interactivity
They could be supplemented by digital tools but cannot completely replace them,109,generic
"students need socialisation, too and face-to-face classes is one of the best way for that",109,interactivity
"I partially agree that Ochestration refers to teacher interventions. Teacher intervention is a part of Orchestration, but teacher could also organize and structure the learning activities in Orchestration.",109,learning
I agree @Aza,109,generic
Also there are physical health issues with just being depended on digital tools.,109,generic
Eye strain,109,generic
"i think digital learning oppurtunities is for deeping knowledge, not for learning completly unkown materials",109,learning
Headaches too,109,generic
"yeah, heath is more important. also duration of face-to-face class can be longer",109,interactivity
I disagree @ Aza. Sometimes you can use digital learning tools to explore and learn completely new materials.,109,learning
"But in a formal education, a teacher as an orchestrater is required",109,learning
"oh, that's true",109,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Learning arrangements refers to learnig resources. Why?,109,learning
"i haven't said orchestration is quite interesting, as it involves planing and supporting learning activities, combination of different forms... this is up to teacher",109,learning
I do not agreee @Jill,109,generic
Learning arrangement refers to the specification of how the learning will take place.,109,learning
"for me, learning arrangments is not only what is taught, but how is taught",109,learning
"Learning arrangement includes specification of learning resources, methods, learning goals etc",109,learning
Yeah. I agree with you @Aza,109,generic
"so, it might be said like that:  learning arrangements involves learning resources",109,learning
yeah,109,generic
how about facebook group for learning?,109,interactivity
"It could be useful , specially for adult education.",109,generic
A lot of people who never had formal education are in Facebook and know the platform. That platform could be used for adult learning.,109,learning
"i think so, but i can't be only one source source for comunication connected to learning",109,learning
Yeah. It can't be in ideal scenario.,109,generic
Blended learning is the best approach.,109,interactivity
i agree 'that platform is useful for eduly learning'.,109,learning
"yeah, flex model or rotation model seems useful",109,interactivity
Do you know about those models? Have you experienced them as a student/teacher?,109,generic
"i have not experienced rotation model, but i'd like to try it, when i read about it seemed interesting",109,interactivity
"i know flex model but i do not have much experience with it, as well",109,interactivity
how about you?,109,generic
I have not experience them as well,109,generic
But it could be nice implementation for blended learning,109,interactivity
"as you said, especially the experienced rotation model",109,interactivity
yeah,109,generic
I guess we are done with today's session.,109,generic
Or are we supposed to stay until 4 pm?,109,generic
Do you know?,109,generic
"i think so, and no we aren't ...",109,generic
Hmm then,109,generic
duration of discusion is 45 minute as i know,109,generic
I guess we can end it,109,generic
I wish you a good day ahead :),109,generic
And see you next weeek,109,generic
"it is alerady evening for me, so yeah",109,generic
Ahh okay then. Have a nice evening :D,109,generic
Bye!,109,generic
it was nice to discuss with you,109,generic
have a nice day,109,generic
bye,109,generic

1. Evaluative vs descriptive -- Ms Brown vs Ms Allen,108,transmission
2. Is enough to give the correct answers?,108,generic
"3. feedback by teacher, peers, technology - AND a combination of all",108,transmission
4. Effective feedback using technology is possible... but emotional aspects are commonly missing,108,transmission
A chat forum the whole classroom or in little groups?,108,interactivity
a lot yes,108,generic
a phd :D,108,generic
ah,108,generic
ah jezz,108,generic
"ah yes, sure",108,generic
"ah, nice point ... i like the idea!",108,generic
ahhh,108,generic
ahhhh you mean the course,108,generic
all these terminologies,108,generic
And about mrs allen...,108,generic
and can cause conflicts #,108,generic
and in a flipped classroom the preparation oftentimes happens individually or in small teams ... so they whatch the prepared material at home,108,interactivity
"And in order to help them to give a good feedback, we can give them a ''game guide'' where they can browse and learn how to give feedback",108,transmission
and orchestration is a good point ... it displays nicely how and to which parts technology can be implemented ... in and beyond the classroom,108,learning
And we could even include a edutechler in the school to help teachers :),108,generic
and we have it ;),108,generic
and what do you think about e-portfolio?,108,generic
Are you there?,108,generic
are you there?,108,generic
as you said,108,generic
back in the days my history teacher wrote on an interactive white board with a black permanent maker,108,interactivity
Because for primary school is difficult to use them... and more if they are E-portfolios and not just portfolios ahah,108,learning
Because I think it is not very descriptive.. he can just see if their answers were correct or not,108,generic
because learners will keep asking WHY,108,generic
being social CAN and IS happening in real life AND online ... it is not exclusive,108,generic
"btw.. i recognized the ""typing button"" in the upper corner ... nice :D",108,generic
But for that we have to deal with the second point of the discussion,108,generic
but maybe it is nice for us to do so ....,108,generic
but not for everything,108,generic
but the time saved now must be invested later on to reach a sustainable learning effect i guess,108,learning
"But there are others that can promote a sharing of experience, of content, of interests...",108,generic
Bye! :),108,generic
Can we leave Jill?,108,generic
Chat in Teams is better :),108,generic
Discuss to what extent you agree or disagree with Mr Heineken and Ms Wells.,108,generic
divided is a good word here ... badges create parties,108,generic
Do we start?,108,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: E-portfolios display accomplishments. Why?,108,learning
Do you both agree with the following statement: Mobile learning refers to learning with mobile devices. Why?,108,interactivity
Do you both agree with the following statement: Roles refers to roles in classroom. Why?,108,interactivity
do you know untin we have time?,108,generic
Don't you agree?,108,generic
ehat do you think?,108,generic
Exactly,108,generic
Exactly,108,generic
Exactly,108,generic
"exactly, and students compare themselves and it created a competitive atmosphere",108,generic

first task,108,generic
for example?,108,generic

Good :),108,generic
good point,108,generic
Got it ;),108,generic
Great :),108,generic
Great :)),108,generic
great idea - like a chat forum,108,generic
Great!,108,generic
great!,108,generic
group evaluation can also happen via video - to meet the lack of socio emotional aspects to a certain extent,108,transmission
haha nice,108,generic
hahah yes a lot,108,generic
hahaha good decision you made,108,generic
hahaha this chat is very basic,108,generic
hahahahha,108,generic
HAHAHHA,108,generic
hahhahahhahahahha,108,generic
Have a nice day :),108,generic
he also is concerned about people loosing social contacts via sm,108,generic
Hello :),108,generic
Hey :),108,generic
Hey :),108,generic
"hey, are you there?:)",108,generic
hi :),108,generic
his concern however seems a bit paradox,108,generic
"hm for the whole class the chat would need some mentoring, i guess ... it depends on how fluent learners are with using the technology and how they follow the communication rules and how serious they take it",108,learning
"hm i like the motivational aspect of them, too but they should be used limited, otherwise they will lose their value",108,generic
hm this is not nice,108,generic
"hm, might be true ... the awareness of the underlying algorithm might be an important concept to grasp before and while using social media (sm)",108,generic
Honestly I thought about classroom because I am a primary education teacher,108,generic
How are you? :),108,generic
How can Mr. Heineken and Ms. Wells effectively implement digital learning opportunities?,108,interactivity
hybrid - the middle way - is the solution here to combine advantages from both perspectives,108,generic
hybrid means that for instance a learning video can be watched at home and be discussed in face to face... at the same time flipped and hybrid,108,learning
"hybrid, in my understanding includes a flipped classroom... am i wron?",108,interactivity
I agree on that he at least considers to implement feedback ...,108,transmission
I agree with you,108,generic
i agree!,108,generic
i agree! The first thing is that teachers gain an understanding about what is available and possible before they implement technology in their classrooms,108,interactivity
i donno,108,generic
i dont agree on Jills statement... role is a matter of definition again. a teacher does not equal a teacher. Teacher A can act differently in a class that teacher B. but both should guide and not direct in the first point,108,generic
"I don't know if you write something, I can't see :(",108,generic
I feel technology is evolving much faster than how we apply it to education...,108,generic
I hate I can't reply or answer with thumbs up,108,generic
I have just seen that we should write our own,108,generic
I like it - but better might be an immediate feedback - without any time delay in between ... do you know what i mean?,108,transmission
I like that,108,generic
i like the gamification aspect,108,generic
I like them :),108,generic
"I mean, since I was a teenager I have used social media and I would have loved that someone talks to me about how I can learn by joining groups of my interest",108,interactivity
i think at this moment i decided to become an educational technologist,108,generic
"I think flipped classroom need a bigger development... I mean, there is not a lot about it... I think that people as me ahahha are confused about what it actually is... I feel a better solution is to provide teachers with a better understanding about all the learning platforms and resources that they have available",108,learning
I think he has the point of view of many adults that didn't interact in social media,108,interactivity
I think his approach is not very ''educational'' becuase it doesn't lead to learning... Students will just focus on the number of right answers they have and not in the possibilties of learning they have by doing this ''exam'',108,learning
I think hybrid is trying to have everything but not really getting it... it is very difficult to give the same support to students that are in the class than students who arre online,108,generic
i think it is just an algorithm dropping prewritten questions :D,108,generic
I think it is until 45,108,generic
I think it is until 8.45,108,generic
I think it is until 8.45,108,generic
i think they are nice to guide you towards the correct solution after you gave a wrong answer,108,generic
I think they are representing the two types of feedback: evaluative and descriptive,108,transmission
I think they can be used for the most difficult tasks for example,108,generic
"i think they do, since they visualize ones learning process",108,learning
I think to know the answer is not enough...,108,generic
I thought it was just giving the opportunity to attend to classes online and face to face,108,interactivity
I totally agree with you on that,108,generic
i tried to send a gif but it does not work lol,108,generic
I was referring to the help provided by the edutechlers hahah sorry,108,generic
i was working in a school and they used to use something similar,108,generic
I would say we should move to models that 'orchestrate' everything,108,learning
"if it is correct not, if my answer was wrong, i would like to now the correct one... did i understood your question correctly?",108,generic
"in my experience online universities have a worse reputation than real life universities, simply because the complete online setting cannot afford the real life advantages",108,generic
in the guide we could help them to use prompts...,108,generic
in the lecture they mentioned prompts ...,108,generic
In the video it says this about hybrid teaching structure: Online registration-Face to face workshop-online learning-ftf workshop-advanced online learning materials,108,interactivity
in which subjects?,108,generic
"is is time to redefine what is meant by ""social"", i think",108,generic
is there a tutor here?:),108,generic
isnt it?,108,generic
it is a good way to help students to regulate their learning too,108,generic
It is true that there are some social networks that are really addictive and do not help a lot in learning,108,interactivity
it was a kind of gamification,108,generic
It was nice to talk with you again,108,generic
it*,108,generic
just to start the summary?,108,generic
just to summarize this,108,generic
Let's go with the task you shared,108,generic
lets maybe apply the idea of orchestration and briefly develop a flipped classroom lesson?,108,interactivity
lets start with the first question: Discuss to what extent you agree with Ms. Brown's and/or Ms. Allen's reasoning.,108,generic
lets use the time... they mentioned badges,108,generic
like facebook groups or do you mean other platforms?,108,interactivity
Like in secondary school...,108,generic
"Mmm as far as I know, mobile learning is the one that can happen through mobile phones, tablets.. so yes i would agree on that",108,interactivity
mmm maybe we could start from adults?,108,generic
Mmmm I am not that sure about hybrid eeducation,108,interactivity
More than hybrid I would prefer flipped classroom for example,108,interactivity
My teacher tried to do zoom in a tablet that was connected to a projector by approaching the tablet to the screen,108,generic
nice .. so lets directly jump in?,108,generic
nice to hear that you would actually work directly with children!:),108,generic
no hahaha,108,generic
no worries!<3,108,generic
"no, i would like to know the WHY ... i like to use quiz apps and some provide the correct answer. If i am interested in a topic, i google why it is like this",108,interactivity
"No, they were stamps of harry potter haha",108,generic
"of course, it is a job",108,generic
oh,108,generic
Oh hi Jane :),108,generic
oh yes!,108,generic
ok,108,generic
okay - but are we allowed to?:D,108,generic
"Okay before moving to the next one, imagine you are one of the learners.. do you think that only by giving you the correct answer you would be more engaged to ask your doubts??",108,generic
"okay due to time: individual preparation with explanation videos via WWW, discussion phase face to face in school, and application in class",108,interactivity
Okay let's leave,108,generic
okay okay :D,108,generic
"okay, i will wait until 8.10/8.15",108,generic
"okay, so what about Mrs Allen then?",108,generic
"okay, thanks again :) bye",108,generic
okok,108,generic
Or maybe they don't even ask and we get the same result than from ms brown...,108,generic
or the less engaging activities,108,generic
Perfect,108,generic
Perfect,108,generic
"reddit is a nice point ... it, in my eyes, affords forming learning communities very well ...",108,generic
roughly,108,generic
Same for me,108,generic
same here :D,108,generic
she argues that it is more time efficient,108,generic
"she considers to inform the learners about WHAT was wrong, however not explaining WHy",108,generic
Should we wait until 8.45?,108,generic
since we have a few min left... they also mentioned badges... what do you think about this?,108,generic
so a first approach is to set up a course for teachers themselves to dive in to the topic of edutech? at least for mr heineken,108,generic
so lets see how we can improve their approaches...,108,generic
"so lets talk about ms wells then ... she seems to take this ""social by nature"" a bit too",108,generic
"so we can work with: solo, team, class and web as ""levels""",108,generic
So we just have to write a paragraph for each one,108,generic
So you are right :),108,generic
"so, i handed in my assignment yesterday and i mentioned the flipped classroom as a promising solution, too ... would you like to explain your thoughts on that?",108,interactivity
"So, we can provide the teachers a course that they can register online, then they have some meetings in person to discuss about the topics presented, and they have access to videos, blogs, social media, where they can find info?",108,interactivity
some of my message arent displayed here,108,generic
"Students were super engaged.. but not in doing the tasks, just in getting the badges",108,generic
summary*,108,generic
sure,108,generic
TASK: How could Ms. Brown design an effective feedback process with technology?,108,transmission
technolgy does afford other actions that a teacher can do (for instance become less salient or completely absent),108,generic
Thank you :D,108,generic
thank you for this,108,generic
Thank you too and sorry for yesterday,108,generic
"That is true, I mean... it is more efficent and faster :)",108,generic
That would help to implement a good orchestration in class,108,generic
That's great!!!,108,generic
thats what i said - it is just evaluation. all the feedback he uses steems from a behavioural point of view,108,transmission
the emotional aspect is missing,108,generic
the idea of portfolios is used at child and adults is also a good thing,108,generic
The only thing it seems difficult to me to give as an effective online feedback as face-to-face feedback,108,transmission
the thing is... which kind of feedback does he want to implement?,108,generic
they can adapt to your learning progress - data can be analysed by the algorithm to see where you need hints,108,learning
they should be given the time and be paid for this :D,108,generic
they were divided in hp's houses,108,generic
they*,108,generic
this is one of the arguments i wrote down,108,generic
Totally agre!!,108,generic
true ... it is always about what users select to be confronted with in their timelines,108,generic
true!,108,generic
true! but both barely use description,108,generic
"true, its a bit difficult",108,generic
uhhhh I thought we had to do it later,108,generic
until 8.45,108,generic
until when do we have time? how long is this discussion planned?:D,108,generic
until when do we have time? isnt it 45?,108,generic
was this in form of stickers the students received? :D,108,generic
We can highlight the main points we talk and then we can work individually in our assignments,108,generic
we can start to do it,108,generic
We could also combine here peer feedback!,108,generic
"We could do something... when students finish their test, they will receive the answers and the test of someone, they have to check it and later give them feedback by video...",108,transmission
we have until 8.45,108,generic
"We need face to face lessons... we need to interact by seeing each other in person, by communicating seeing our gestures...",108,generic
we will see.. thank you for this discussion :),108,generic
"Well I have to leave, it was nice to work with you!! Have a nice week:)",108,generic
Well I think here we have the controversial issue of the use of social media in education...,108,interactivity
"Well in my case I used it in didactics of mathematics, in English for primary school... and in ICT resources course",108,generic
"Well, do we move to the second question?",108,generic
what are the point you agree on whith his approach?,108,generic
What are your plans for the future? :),108,generic
What do you mean?,108,generic
what do you think about this statement?,108,generic
what do you think about this?,108,generic
what do you think?,108,generic
"When these badges are used for positive reinforcement only, they might be a good thing ... i remembered that i often received a sticker for ""a messy writing style"" ._.",108,learning
would you rather create online learning material for adults or children?,108,generic
Wow yes!!!,108,generic
wrong*,108,generic
Wwe have seen with the pandemic situation is that live can't only happen through a screen,108,generic
yeah again we see two extreme positions here,108,generic
yeah and this exactly it - by implementing online and face to face sessions,108,generic
yeah exactly ... okay ... i was confused too,108,generic
yeah i mean ... she did not know it better,108,generic
"yeah, unfortunately we directly had to experience this ... it works for a while, if you know that there is a time at which it ends",108,generic
yes,108,generic
Yes,108,generic
Yes I agree,108,generic
Yes I agree,108,generic
Yes I agree,108,generic
Yes I see what you mean,108,generic
Yes I see your point...,108,generic
Yes I totally agree,108,generic
Yes I was referring that after having the possibility to read if it was right... would you do something?,108,generic
Yes it is extreme,108,generic
Yes it is the same in Spain,108,generic
Yes okay we are on the same boat hahaha,108,generic
yes that is fine,108,generic
Yes that would be a good sumary,108,generic
Yes that would give them a basic knowledge about what is really going on on social media and how they could use technology in education,108,generic
yes we do!:),108,generic
yes!,108,generic
Yes!,108,generic
Yes! I agree with you about reddit,108,generic
Yes! Sometimes they want to be super innovative and they just work with computers as they would work with pen and paper,108,generic
Yes!!!,108,generic
"Yes, and reddit... here in social media wikis and web blogs are also included",108,interactivity
"Yes, but don't you think that universities are feeling comfortable in remote education and they don't want to move?",108,interactivity
"Yes, everything depends on how the teacher implements it",108,generic
"Yes, how can we use prompts that are ''personalised'' in technological environments?",108,generic
"Yes, I also think it is commonly used at uni",108,generic
"Yes, I partially agree with her because it is a good starting point to give them the answers... but again, it is not the best solution",108,generic
"yes, it is true that I think they work better when students are aware of their learning",108,generic
"Yes, it is true that we are loosing social contacts, but more than loosing contacts I think we ar eloosing the quality of the relationships we had",108,interactivity
"Yes, okay!",108,generic
"Yes, that would help teachers to work when they have time available",108,generic
"Yes, that's good",108,generic
you have a good point regarding his approach! I totally agree,108,generic
you too!:),108,generic
Hello :),108,generic
Hey :),108,generic
Are you there?,108,generic
yes,108,generic
Great!,108,generic
lets start with the first question: Discuss to what extent you agree with Ms. Brown's and/or Ms. Allen's reasoning.,108,generic
Perfect,108,generic
I think they are representing the two types of feedback: evaluative and descriptive,108,transmission
I agree on that he at least considers to implement feedback ...,108,transmission
true! but both barely use description,108,generic
the thing is... which kind of feedback does he want to implement?,108,transmission
Because I think it is not very descriptive.. he can just see if their answers were correct or not,108,generic
they*,108,generic
thats what i said - it is just evaluation. all the feedback he uses steems from a behavioural point of view,108,transmission
what are the point you agree on whith his approach?,108,generic
Yes I agree,108,generic
"okay, so what about Mrs Allen then?",108,generic
I think his approach is not very ''educational'' becuase it doesn't lead to learning... Students will just focus on the number of right answers they have and not in the possibilties of learning they have by doing this ''exam'',108,learning
And about mrs allen...,108,generic
"she considers to inform the learners about WHAT was wrong, however not explaining WHy",108,generic
you have a good point regarding his approach! I totally agree,108,generic
"Yes, I partially agree with her because it is a good starting point to give them the answers... but again, it is not the best solution",108,generic
Exactly,108,generic
she argues that it is more time efficient,108,generic
"That is true, I mean... it is more efficent and faster :)",108,generic
but the time saved now must be invested later on to reach a sustainable learning effect i guess,108,generic
Totally agre!!,108,generic
because learners will keep asking WHY,108,generic
so lets see how we can improve their approaches...,108,generic
TASK: How could Ms. Brown design an effective feedback process with technology?,108,transmission
Or maybe they don't even ask and we get the same result than from ms brown...,108,generic
Exactly,108,generic
"Okay before moving to the next one, imagine you are one of the learners.. do you think that only by giving you the correct answer you would be more engaged to ask your doubts??",108,learning
"if it is correct not, if my answer was wrong, i would like to now the correct one... did i understood your question correctly?",108,generic
ahhh,108,generic
Yes I was referring that after having the possibility to read if it was right... would you do something?,108,generic
I think to know the answer is not enough...,108,generic
"no, i would like to know the WHY ... i like to use quiz apps and some provide the correct answer. If i am interested in a topic, i google why it is like this",108,generic
yes!,108,generic
Yes okay we are on the same boat hahaha,108,generic
:D,108,generic
Great :)),108,generic
Let's go with the task you shared,108,generic
sure,108,generic
in the lecture they mentioned prompts ...,108,generic
"Yes, how can we use prompts that are ''personalised'' in technological environments?",108,generic
i think they are nice to guide you towards the correct solution after you gave a wrong answer,108,generic
Yes I agree,108,generic
The only thing it seems difficult to me to give as an effective online feedback as face-to-face feedback,108,transmission
they can adapt to your learning progress - data can be analysed by the algorithm to see where you need hints,108,learning
i agree!,108,generic
the emotional aspect is missing,108,generic
Exactly...,108,generic
We could also combine here peer feedback!,108,generic
great idea - like a chat forum,108,generic
Yes!,108,generic
group evaluation can also happen via video - to meet the lack of socio emotional aspects to a certain extent,108,interactivity
A chat forum the whole classroom or in little groups?,108,interactivity
Wow yes!!!,108,generic
"hm for the whole class the chat would need some mentoring, i guess ... it depends on how fluent learners are with using the technology and how they follow the communication rules and how serious they take it",108,interactivity
"We could do something... when students finish their test, they will receive the answers and the test of someone, they have to check it and later give them feedback by video...",108,transmission
Yes I agree,108,generic
"And in order to help them to give a good feedback, we can give them a ''game guide'' where they can browse and learn how to give feedback",108,transmission
I like it - but better might be an immediate feedback - without any time delay in between ... do you know what i mean?,108,transmission
i like the gamification aspect,108,generic
"Yes, okay!",108,generic
until when do we have time? how long is this discussion planned?:D,108,generic
in the guide we could help them to use prompts...,108,generic
I think it is until 8.45,108,generic
I think it is until 8.45,108,generic
"I don't know if you write something, I can't see :(",108,generic
"true, its a bit difficult",108,generic
do you know untin we have time?,108,generic
until 8.45,108,generic
just to start the summary?,108,generic
uhhhh I thought we had to do it later,108,generic
just to summarize this,108,generic
ah,108,generic
okok,108,generic
we have until 8.45,108,generic
we can start to do it,108,generic
okay - but are we allowed to?:D,108,generic
no hahaha,108,generic
some of my message arent displayed here,108,generic
I have just seen that we should write our own,108,generic
Same for me,108,generic
but maybe it is nice for us to do so ....,108,generic
hm this is not nice,108,generic
We can highlight the main points we talk and then we can work individually in our assignments,108,generic
1. Evaluative vs descriptive -- Ms Brown vs Ms Allen,108,transmission
2. Is enough to give the correct answers?,108,generic
"3. feedback by teacher, peers, technology - AND a combination of all",108,transmission
4. Effective feedback using technology is possible... but emotional aspects are commonly missing,108,transmission
great!,108,generic
So we just have to write a paragraph for each one,108,generic
and we have it ;),108,generic
since we have a few min left... they also mentioned badges... what do you think about this?,108,generic
yes we do!:),108,generic
Great :),108,generic
Should we wait until 8.45?,108,generic
lets use the time... they mentioned badges,108,generic
what do you think about this?,108,generic
oh yes!,108,generic
i was working in a school and they used to use something similar,108,generic
"Students were super engaged.. but not in doing the tasks, just in getting the badges",108,generic
what do you think?,108,generic
was this in form of stickers the students received? :D,108,generic
"No, they were stamps of harry potter haha",108,generic
it was a kind of gamification,108,generic
"hm i like the motivational aspect of them, too but they should be used limited, otherwise they will lose their value",108,generic
haha nice,108,generic
they were divided in hp's houses,108,generic
Yes I totally agree,108,generic
I think they can be used for the most difficult tasks for example,108,generic
or the less engaging activities,108,generic
but not for everything,108,generic
divided is a good word here ... badges create parties,108,generic
and can cause conflicts #,108,generic
"exactly, and students compare themselves and it created a competitive atmosphere",108,generic
a lot yes,108,generic
and what do you think about e-portfolio?,108,generic
"When these badges are used for positive reinforcement only, they might be a good thing ... i remembered that i often received a sticker for ""a messy writing style"" ._.",108,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: E-portfolios display accomplishments. Why?,108,generic
"ah, nice point ... i like the idea!",108,generic
"i think they do, since they visualize ones learning process",108,learning
Oh hi Jane :),108,generic
"yes, it is true that I think they work better when students are aware of their learning",108,generic
Like in secondary school...,108,generic
Because for primary school is difficult to use them... and more if they are E-portfolios and not just portfolios ahah,108,learning
the idea of portfolios is used at child and adults is also a good thing,108,learning
"Yes, I also think it is commonly used at uni",108,generic
I like them :),108,generic
it is a good way to help students to regulate their learning too,108,generic
in which subjects?,108,generic
"Well in my case I used it in didactics of mathematics, in English for primary school... and in ICT resources course",108,generic
"Well I have to leave, it was nice to work with you!! Have a nice week:)",108,generic
you too!:),108,generic
thank you for this,108,generic
"hey, are you there?:)",108,generic
are you there?,108,generic
"okay, i will wait until 8.10/8.15",108,generic
is there a tutor here?:),108,generic
hi :),108,generic
Hey :),108,generic
How are you? :),108,generic
"fine thanks, you?",108,generic
Fine too :),108,generic
Do we start?,108,generic
nice .. so lets directly jump in?,108,generic
okay okay :D,108,generic
Discuss to what extent you agree or disagree with Mr Heineken and Ms Wells.,108,generic
Perfect,108,generic
first task,108,generic
Well I think here we have the controversial issue of the use of social media in education...,108,interactivity
yeah again we see two extreme positions here,108,generic
Exactly,108,generic
". In his opinion, social media leads to young people reading less and a lack of engagement with intellectually challenging content",108,interactivity
what do you think about this statement?,108,generic
I think he has the point of view of many adults that didn't interact in social media,108,generic
It is true that there are some social networks that are really addictive and do not help a lot in learning,108,interactivity
"But there are others that can promote a sharing of experience, of content, of interests...",108,interactivity
true ... it is always about what users select to be confronted with in their timelines,108,generic
for example?,108,generic
like facebook groups or do you mean other platforms?,108,interactivity
"Exactly, maybe the main problem comes when people don't know how to use them?",108,generic
"Yes, and reddit... here in social media wikis and web blogs are also included",108,interactivity
"hm, might be true ... the awareness of the underlying algorithm might be an important concept to grasp before and while using social media (sm)",108,interactivity
I agree with you,108,generic
"reddit is a nice point ... it, in my eyes, affords forming learning communities very well ...",108,generic
"I mean, since I was a teenager I have used social media and I would have loved that someone talks to me about how I can learn by joining groups of my interest",108,interactivity
he also is concerned about people loosing social contacts via sm,108,generic
same here :D,108,generic
Yes! I agree with you about reddit,108,generic
his concern however seems a bit paradox,108,generic
"is is time to redefine what is meant by ""social"", i think",108,generic
"Yes, it is true that we are loosing social contacts, but more than loosing contacts I think we ar eloosing the quality of the relationships we had",108,generic
it*,108,generic
good point,108,generic
What do you mean?,108,generic
being social CAN and IS happening in real life AND online ... it is not exclusive,108,generic
"Exatly, we are social by nature",108,generic
"so lets talk about ms wells then ... she seems to take this ""social by nature"" a bit too",108,generic
i donno,108,generic
extreme?,108,generic
Yes it is extreme,108,generic
Wwe have seen with the pandemic situation is that live can't only happen through a screen,108,generic
"We need face to face lessons... we need to interact by seeing each other in person, by communicating seeing our gestures...",108,interactivity
Don't you agree?,108,generic
"yeah, unfortunately we directly had to experience this ... it works for a while, if you know that there is a time at which it ends",108,generic
hybrid - the middle way - is the solution here to combine advantages from both perspectives,108,generic
ehat do you think?,108,generic
"Yes, but don't you think that universities are feeling comfortable in remote education and they don't want to move?",108,generic
More than hybrid I would prefer flipped classroom for example,108,interactivity
I think hybrid is trying to have everything but not really getting it... it is very difficult to give the same support to students that are in the class than students who arre online,108,interactivity
"in my experience online universities have a worse reputation than real life universities, simply because the complete online setting cannot afford the real life advantages",108,interactivity
I would say we should move to models that 'orchestrate' everything,108,generic
Yes it is the same in Spain,108,generic
"hybrid, in my understanding includes a flipped classroom... am i wron?",108,generic
wrong*,108,generic
"btw.. i recognized the ""typing button"" in the upper corner ... nice :D",108,generic
hahahahha,108,generic
Mmmm I am not that sure about hybrid eeducation,108,generic
I thought it was just giving the opportunity to attend to classes online and face to face,108,interactivity
and orchestration is a good point ... it displays nicely how and to which parts technology can be implemented ... in and beyond the classroom,108,learning
I totally agree with you on that,108,generic
But for that we have to deal with the second point of the discussion,108,generic
How can Mr. Heineken and Ms. Wells effectively implement digital learning opportunities?,108,interactivity
yeah and this exactly it - by implementing online and face to face sessions,108,interactivity
Good :),108,generic
hybrid means that for instance a learning video can be watched at home and be discussed in face to face... at the same time flipped and hybrid,108,interactivity
isnt it?,108,generic
In the video it says this about hybrid teaching structure: Online registration-Face to face workshop-online learning-ftf workshop-advanced online learning materials,108,interactivity
So you are right :),108,generic
"""Hybrid Learning is a hybrid approach that builds on the successes of flipped, blended, remote, distance and online learning to intentionally create learner-centered experiences that are profoundly personalized, relevant and engaging.""",108,interactivity
Got it ;),108,generic
yeah exactly ... okay ... i was confused too,108,generic
all these terminologies,108,generic
hahah yes a lot,108,generic
i tried to send a gif but it does not work lol,108,generic
*exploding head*,108,generic
hahaha this chat is very basic,108,generic
I hate I can't reply or answer with thumbs up,108,generic
true!,108,generic
Chat in Teams is better :),108,generic
"Well, do we move to the second question?",108,generic
"so, i handed in my assignment yesterday and i mentioned the flipped classroom as a promising solution, too ... would you like to explain your thoughts on that?",108,interactivity
"ah yes, sure",108,generic
"""The advantage is that this can happen self-paced and potentially connected to a collaborative task, which is solved in learning communities on social media""",108,interactivity
this is one of the arguments i wrote down,108,generic
"I think flipped classroom need a bigger development... I mean, there is not a lot about it... I think that people as me ahahha are confused about what it actually is... I feel a better solution is to provide teachers with a better understanding about all the learning platforms and resources that they have available",108,interactivity
Yes I see your point...,108,generic
i agree! The first thing is that teachers gain an understanding about what is available and possible before they implement technology in their classrooms,108,generic
Yes! Sometimes they want to be super innovative and they just work with computers as they would work with pen and paper,108,generic
back in the days my history teacher wrote on an interactive white board with a black permanent maker,108,generic
I feel technology is evolving much faster than how we apply it to education...,108,generic
HAHAHHA,108,generic
i think at this moment i decided to become an educational technologist,108,generic
My teacher tried to do zoom in a tablet that was connected to a projector by approaching the tablet to the screen,108,generic
yeah i mean ... she did not know it better,108,generic
ah jezz,108,generic
hahaha good decision you made,108,generic
so a first approach is to set up a course for teachers themselves to dive in to the topic of edutech? at least for mr heineken,108,generic
Yes that would give them a basic knowledge about what is really going on on social media and how they could use technology in education,108,interactivity
lets maybe apply the idea of orchestration and briefly develop a flipped classroom lesson?,108,interactivity
Yes!!!,108,generic
roughly,108,generic
I like that,108,generic
ok,108,generic
"so we can work with: solo, team, class and web as ""levels""",108,generic
"So, we can provide the teachers a course that they can register online, then they have some meetings in person to discuss about the topics presented, and they have access to videos, blogs, social media, where they can find info?",108,generic
"Yes, that's good",108,generic
and in a flipped classroom the preparation oftentimes happens individually or in small teams ... so they whatch the prepared material at home,108,interactivity
as you said,108,generic
And we could even include a edutechler in the school to help teachers :),108,generic
"Yes, that would help teachers to work when they have time available",108,generic
they should be given the time and be paid for this :D,108,generic
"of course, it is a job",108,generic
ahhhh you mean the course,108,generic
yes that is fine,108,generic
"for taking part in it, yes",108,generic
I was referring to the help provided by the edutechlers hahah sorry,108,generic
"okay due to time: individual preparation with explanation videos via WWW, discussion phase face to face in school, and application in class",108,generic
Yes that would be a good sumary,108,generic
summary*,108,generic
That would help to implement a good orchestration in class,108,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Roles refers to roles in classroom. Why?,108,interactivity
would you rather create online learning material for adults or children?,108,interactivity
oh,108,generic
mmm maybe we could start from adults?,108,generic
Honestly I thought about classroom because I am a primary education teacher,108,generic
i dont agree on Jills statement... role is a matter of definition again. a teacher does not equal a teacher. Teacher A can act differently in a class that teacher B. but both should guide and not direct in the first point,108,interactivity
Yes I see what you mean,108,generic
technolgy does afford other actions that a teacher can do (for instance become less salient or completely absent),108,generic
"Yes, everything depends on how the teacher implements it",108,generic
nice to hear that you would actually work directly with children!:),108,generic
Thank you :D,108,generic
What are your plans for the future? :),108,generic
a phd :D,108,generic
That's great!!!,108,generic
we will see.. thank you for this discussion :),108,generic
Thank you too and sorry for yesterday,108,generic
It was nice to talk with you again,108,generic
Have a nice day :),108,generic
no worries!<3,108,generic
Do you both agree with the following statement: Mobile learning refers to learning with mobile devices. Why?,108,interactivity
until when do we have time? isnt it 45?,108,generic
"Mmm as far as I know, mobile learning is the one that can happen through mobile phones, tablets.. so yes i would agree on that",108,learning
Yes,108,generic
I think it is until 45,108,generic
Can we leave Jill?,108,generic
i think it is just an algorithm dropping prewritten questions :D,108,generic
